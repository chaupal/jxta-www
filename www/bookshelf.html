<img src="/branding/images/cover-3990-small.JPG"><P>
<u>Java P2P Unleashed</u> provides a single source for Java developers who want
to develop P2P  systems. The book explains the benefits of each technology
and shows how to fit the P2P  "pieces" together - both in building new
systems and integrating with existing ones.
<P>
The book starts with a discussion of the P2P architecture, referencing similarities
with existing,  familiar systems while previewing several types of P2P
applications. It explains how to plan ahead for security, routing,
performance and other issues when developing a P2P application.
Each technology included in the book - JXTA, Jini, JavaSpaces, J2EE, Web
services - is approached from a P2P perspective, focusing on implementation
concerns Java developers will face while using them. The last section
includes several large-scale examples of different P2P applications -
managing content, building communities, integrating services, routing
messages, and using intelligent agents to gather information. The final
chapter looks ahead to future developments in Java P2P technologies.

<u>JXTA in a Nutshell</u>, A Desktop Quick Reference. 
<P>
Written by key members of Sun Microsystem's Project JXTA, <u>JXTA in a 
Nutshell</u> is the definitive reference to the most solid platform yet for 
Peer-to-Peer distributed computing. "P2P" enables users with the same 
networking application to connect with each other and directly interact 
with other people computers anywhere on the network. JXTA is a giant 
step forward in the evolution of P2P.
<P>
O'Reilly's pioneering reference is the first and last word on this 
powerful distributed computing technology. The book delivers 
all the information you need to get started, including an overview of 
P2P distributed computing, an explanation of the JXTA Project's new 
platform, and ways that developers can become a part of the development 
effort. It introduces major concepts in a hands-on way by 
explaining them in context to the shell, and contains a complete 
reference to the JXTA application bindings. Also included is the full 
JXTA protocol specification. The book covers important topics such as 
security, and how the JXTA technology fits into the standard Java classes.
