      <p>Latest Update - May 28, 2007 - KERIKA 1.1 IS RELEASED!</p>
      <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Kerika version 1.1, a JXTA-based 
        Java application that provides a visual context for team collaboration, 
        with support for process templates, document management and sharing of 
        large files. We released a beta version a year ago, that some of you may 
        have tried out, and based upon the feedback we got we have made a bunch 
        of improvements:</p>
      <p>1. Sharing projects just became a whole lot easier: previously: just 
        add email address to the project's team list and Kerika takes care of 
        the rest. Other Kerika users who are online get a full set of project 
        information (Idea Pages, content, etc.), while a storage server holds 
        messages for offline users. But best of all: if your team includes people 
        who are not Kerika users, they get their project updates sent to them 
        automatically as emails. This means that you don't have to get everyone 
        in the team to use Kerika before you start using it!</p>
      <p>2. We now have more tightly synchronized views for all members of a project: 
        whenever someone moves an item on an Idea Page, or extends a project, 
        or makes some visual changes, or adds content, or attaches notes to items, 
        or deletes items, or... these changes get reflected for all members of 
        the team. Which means that everyone on the team always has the big picture, 
        which we call &quot;sharing content in context&quot;. Every Idea Page 
        has its own Trash (Recycle Bin), so if any member of the team deletes 
        an item from a project, any other team member can restore it later.</p>
      <p>3. The code is all in Java, so go ahead and try it out on Macs, Windows 
        and Linux. The UI looks identical on all platforms because we built our 
        widget set, which is based upon the Mac's Aqua style.</p>
      <p>4. For added privacy, users can set up their own &quot;private storage 
        server&quot; on any machine they have so long as it is reliably accessible 
        by the rest of the team. By setting up a private server you can create 
        a &quot;ring of trust&quot;: if any of your team members are offline, 
        updates intended for them will be stored on your private server, which 
        operates entirely under your control.</p>
      <p>The popular document management feature works as before: you can attach 
        notes to documents, and whenever anyone edits a shared document, this 
        modified version is sent to everyone else on the team; Kerika takes care 
        of all the filing for everyone's computers.</p>
      <p>Please take a look at one of the Flash demos we have available at http://www.kerika.com/flash_demos.html 
        and then give this JXTA app a whirl! Getting started is pretty simple: 
        signup by providing a name and email address at https://sales.kerika.com/myaccount.php; 
        then click on the link in the confirmation email we send you to get your 
        personal License Key. After downloading and installing Kerika, start it 
        up and give it your License Key and you are good to go.</p>
      <p>Your feedback would be much appreciated. </p>

        <p> Dextrus Prosoft Consulting is a Technology Project Management Consulting 
          and Systems Development Services company. Their project management methods 
          are based on best project management practices learned through the varied 
          consulting practices and engagements. Their method allows them to assist 
          their clients by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mitigating project's risks, </li>
          <li>clearing communications, </li>
          <li>maintaining and managing healthy project environment and </li>
          <li>adopting a successful project management model applied to customer 
            projects. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Their systems development methods address the business needs, make 
          a fine distinction between the technological and corporate goals and 
          fulfills the strategic objectives of deploying technology targets.</p>
        <p> Their current product is &quot;SENTINEL&quot; - an ideal solution 
          for managing and monitoring the connected enterprise network. SENTINEL 
          is a lightweight tool that is distributed across the network, and utilizes 
          lightweight modules residing in numerous locations around the network. 
          These modules are fully aware of the environment around them and they 
          are intelligent enough to make an informed decision about the problems 
          occurring in their vicinity. They are also aware of other peer monitoring 
          modules around them. And they actively share their knowledge with them. 
        </p>
        <p>The P2P paradigm fits neatly into the Sentinel proposed solution. Distributed 
          lightweight peers cooperating to solve a complex problem, which was 
          the dream sold by P2P frameworks. It was a lofty goal till the emergence 
          of commonly accepted protocols under the JXTA P2P framework. Most of 
          the other P2P technologies are designed for file transfers, and Dextrus' 
          plans required more than just P2P file transfers. JXTA has made P2P 
          a viable alternative to the client-server architecture, providing the 
          most flexible, generic and standards based P2P platform available currently. 
        </p>
        <p>With JXTA it has become very easy to rapidly implement a P2P system, 
          which is platform independent and easily available. As such Dextrus 
          Prosoft plan to use JXTA to implement their solution. And with the emergence 
          and gradual acceptance of the JMX (Java Management Extensions) framework 
          by the monitoring industry it would be possible in the near future to 
          write management tools which work with each other. They plan to use 
          the JMX framework extensively along with J2SDK and J2EE to designing 
          a scalable monitoring solution for large networks. JXTA allows them 
          to distribute the processing load among a number of monitoring nodes 
          and thereby eliminating the need for bigger and expensive centralized 
          server. (Compare this to the traditional way to solve the scalability 
          problem in monitoring solutions is to deploy on bigger, faster hardware!)</p>
        <p> Looking back at the decision to choose JXTA Technology, Dextrus Prosoft 
          feel that JXTA is the right way to go with respect to scalable P2P solutions. 
          In the future they see JXTA becoming an integral part of the computing 
          solutions which need to be scalable and which need to work on diverse 
          platforms and environments - JXTA can become glue between complex distributed 
          applications.</p>
        <p> Dextrus invites the JXTA Community to participate by joining their 
          JXTA Community project &quot;<a href="http://sentinel.jxta.org">SENTINEL</a>&quot;.</p>

        <p>For more than fourteen years, <a href="http://www.posam.sk/wwwsite/index.nsf/vdb_HomePage/homepage?OpenDocument">PosAm</a> 
          has been one of the most notable suppliers of advanced information systems 
          in the Slovak market. Their team has implemented many unique solutions 
          in the areas of insurance, banking, industry and government. In all 
          these segments, they helped to improve our clients&rsquo; main and supporting 
          business processes. PosAm, Ltd. advocates open solutions, thus, the 
          company utilizes the whole suite of JAVA technologies (J2EE, Java Web 
          Services). It has implemented a number of Java-based products including 
          portals, knowledge management, document management and e-learning systems. 
        </p>
        <p> Project PETRA (PEer To peeR Application) was started as part of a 
          diploma thesis of one of PosAm's software architects. The aim of the 
          thesis was to design and develop application on a peer-to-peer architecture, 
          explore concepts behind it, and compare it with traditional client/server 
          or multi-tier architectures. This application uses JXTA as a fundamental 
          framework because of it&rsquo;s open and flexible architecture and because 
          of on-going community support assuring future of the technology. </p>
        <p> After a sucessfull first iteration, PETRA was brought to PosAm at 
          the end of 2004. One of PosAm&rsquo;s software divisions started to 
          use PETRA as a complementary way to share technical documentation. PosAm 
          has decided to continue with PETRA,considering it as a possible future 
          commercial product. Consequently, PosAm will earmark part of it&rsquo;s 
          resources to enhance the product&rsquo;s features, gain more experience 
          in the P2P field and explore emerging business opportunities. Currently, 
          a second iteration of PETRA is in progress, such as methods to secure 
          communication within peer groups, communication with peers behind firewalls, 
          etc. </p>
        <p> Tomas Kysela, software architect leading the development of PETRA, 
          sees JXTA as a big step towards changing the way we think about computer 
          networks today. &ldquo;It is very important that JXTA is backed-up by 
          the open-source community. It is the community, which experiments with 
          peer-to-peer concepts and revisits the specification statements. This 
          effort drives the continuous evolution of JXTA towards P2P architecture 
          that will hopefully enable us to move from central architectures with 
          sequential processing to truly distributed architectures and parallel 
          processing that emulate processes occurring in the nature.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>At <a href="http://www.ntt.co.jp/index_f.html">NTT </a>Network Innovation 
          Laboratories, researchers are studying intelligent networks. They hope 
          to support the evolution of various network communities which will reflect 
          human society in the real world. They have been involved investigating 
          the use of JXTA technology since Summer 2002 when the Japanese mailing 
          list <a href="http://groups.yahoo.co.jp/group/ja-jxta/">ja-jxta</a> 
          was launched. </p>
        <p>One of the researchers, Koichi Takasugi, has developed a seamless service 
          platform using JXTA technology. This platform, called Seamless Stream 
          Browsing, provides continuous content-delivery services even if the 
          mobile content-delivery terminal is disconnected from the network, or 
          user switches the content-browsing terminals. He is working on this 
          project with Motonori Nakaura, from NTT's Circumstances Adaptive Online 
          Storage System (CAOSS) group. <font color="#CC0000"></font></p>
        <p> Since this platform is based on JXTA technology, it immediately discovers 
          a substitute or more adequate content-delivery terminal. It is a serverless 
          and completely-distributed system designed to support dynamic network 
          environments. NTT is using the Java implementation of JXTA technology. 
          This product is intended for use by NTT customers. </p>
        <p> Takasugi found JXTA to be the perfect technology for his project for 
          multiple reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is distributed as open source.</li>
          <li>There is a wide range of JXTA resources available both online and 
            hardcopy. </li>
          <li>Online support is available on the JXTA mailing lists. (Developers 
            of the JXTA platform were especially helpful!)</li>
          <li>Platform independence is required for our platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Once development began, the team found significant development cost 
          and time savings. They could focus on their application's functionality, 
          relying on JXTA protocol to seamlessly manage device interactions. Takasugi 
          believes that the big attraction of P2P is its inherent flexibility. 
          Applications using JXTA for P2P are not restricted by network topology 
          and communication scaling. Anonymous communication between devices is 
          an equally important point for pervasive computing environments. They 
          hope that as more people are drawn to JXTA technology, the reliability 
          and performance are developed even further than what is available today.</p>
        <p> Koichi Takasugi works with the developers of <a href="http://jxcube.jxta.org/">JXCube</a> 
          (JXTA eXtreme Cube) project, especially regarding continuity and service 
          mobility issues.</p>

        <P> <a href="http://www.312inc.com">312, Inc.</a> was incorporated in 
          August 2002 with a mission to develop solutions that maximize the global 
          creation of value and harness the power of the Internet. 312's <a href="http://www.312inc.com/solutions.html">solutions</a> 
          empower people to protect what's important to them and concurrently 
          provide access, information, and collaboration from any on-line computer. 
        <p>312's LeanOnMe is simple to use, with state-of-the-art Java &amp; JXTA 
          technologies that automatically backs up your computer to one or more 
          on-line computers (peer-to-peer). Simply select files or folders to 
          protect and then choose someone you can lean on for remote storage and 
          you're done. No tapes, no CD's, no monthly Web storage fees. This is 
          more than just a computer insurance policy; you can actually access 
          your data securely from any on-line computer where LeanOnMe is installed. 
        </p>
        <p>312's LeanOnMe uses JXTA as the 312's LeanSweet peer-to-peer Network 
          infrastructure. The design team selected JXTA technology because the 
          Java / JXTA combination met their requirements to build a platform independent, 
          any-to-any application that works over the Internet. They reviewed virtually 
          all available P2P technologies. Most other technologies were rejected 
          because of their platform dependencies, lack of maturity and support. 
          Their biggest technical objective for P2P was to use the Internet to 
          get through firewalls. All 312 applications are written in Java. LeanOnMe 
          also uses Sun's ultimate strength JCE libraries.</p>
        <p>Sean McCandless, 312's co-founder and CTO has been actively involved 
          in the JXTA mailing lists. <a href="http://www.jxta.org/bios/BioArchive.html#Brookshier">Daniel 
          Brookshier</a>, 312's advisor and contractor, is current serving on

        <P>SparkNet S.A. is an ISP operating in Greece since 1995. It is proud 
          to have been the first to achieve several major accomplishments. It 
          is the first to: 
        <ul>
          <li>be licensed by the Greek National Telecommunications and Post Commission,</li>
          <li>offer ADSL connections in Greece,</li>
          <li>offer Internet Roaming through an exclusive agreement with GRIC. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Their project &#147;Provision and synthesis of services over a P2P 
          network&#148; began March 2003. It is co-financed by the Greek Secretariat 
          for Research and Technology. The aim of this project is to investigate 
          and propose a P2P application where peers could sell services either 
          alone or as a bundle combining their own offers with offers made by 
          other peers. In this setting, a peer could be any small or medium enterprise 
          which has a service to sell. The idea of dynamically creating business 
          alliances and offering bundles by synthesizing the services of many 
          small enterprises could lead to the provision of complete solutions 
          which otherwise only large corporations could supply. </p>
        <p>JXTA technology provides the platform on top of which SparkNet can 
          build a &#147;proof-of-concept&#148; application where different tourist 
          operators would be able to combine and sell services. Operators can 
          form their own groups (using the underlying JXTA notion of a group) 
          representing dynamic alliances, advertise and search for services (using 
          the JXTA resolver protocol) and charge for services (using an add-on 
          protocol being developed).</p>
        <p>From the start, it was maintained that any solution will have to be 
          independent of current practices. This was to ensure that any solution 
          implemented will also be supported three to four years from now. By 
          that time, current assumptions made about the operating environment 
          may be invalid. Initially, the SparkNet development team looked into 
          Gnutella as an alternative. They also examined different architectures 
          like Morpheus, Napster and HyperCup. However, none of these technologies 
          provided the flexibility required. JXTA was the only technology that 
          was flexible and independent of underlying architectures. It was a critical 
          decision when defining the product path. </p>
        <p>This flexibility and independence were strong benefits that they gained 
          from using JXTA technology. An additional benefit, they also have access 
          to a specification document, access to a reference implementation and 
          access to a large set of resources. Furthermore, JXTA ties well with 
          Java, the chosen implementation platform. They also feel that the backing 
          of a strong company like SUN provides assurances about the future of 
          the technology. These are all benefits that are important for a success 
          of a project. A final benefit comes from the use of XML for the description 
          of services. They believe that the move towards a semantic description 
          of services will be vital for the adoption of P2P systems.</p>
        <p>SparkNet S.A. is a strong proponent of open solutions not tied to specific 
          platforms. Thus, the company utilizes the whole suite of JAVA technologies 
          (J2EE, Java Web Services and Jini). It has implemented and employed 
          a number of Java-based products including portals, e-learning systems, 
          etc.</p>
        <p>When asked about SparkNet's vision for JXTA technology, Nicholaos Petalidis, 
          the Research and Development Manager says &quot;We believe that as broadband 
          becomes available to the end customer, focus will move to the edges 
          of the network at the points where information is created. P2P software 
          will be in a unique position to take advantage of this situation. We 
          envisage therefore various virtual P2P networks where people dynamically 
          select repackage and offer information and services. We hope that JXTA 
          will mature into a globally accepted standard for setting up such networks.&quot;</p>
        <p>The SparkNet team has recently started participating in the JXTA community 
          discussions. They plan to participate in the recently proposed JXTA 
          Community project Nexus. They also plan to participate in project Venezia-Gondola 
          which fits in their overall vision of the kind of P2P services that 
          will be required in the near future.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.peercom.co.kr/english">Peercom</a>, located in 
          Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea), was established in August 2003 
          under the catch phrase of "human-centered technology and the system 
          development." They work towards this goal by developing and providing 
          middleware software for ubiquitous computing. Their software creates 
          building blocks for new technologies based upon loosely-coupled distributed 
          computing technologies such as P2P, messaging, etc. </p>
        <p>The main product of the Peercom, called "My Personal Portal", is the 
          service that shifts today's personal computing environment from device-oriented 
          to a human-centric environment. Also called the "personal digital asset 
          management solution," it manages an individual's invaluable digital 
          contents by integrating all devices. It also enables users to approach 
          and utilize any digital content such as (PIMs, mail, files, photos, 
          movies, addresses, my favorites, etc) at anytime and anywhere. My Personal 
          Portal will distribute the most recent version of these digital files, 
          without any physical restriction of time, or spaces like devices or 
          network environment. </p>
        <p>"My Personal Portal" consists of three main services:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="http://www.peercom.co.kr/english/product_1.htm"
 target="_blank">My DeskStation </a>- a window program, which provides replicating 
            and managing peers' contents sorted by data types, </li>
          <li><a href="http://www.peercom.co.kr/english/product_2.htm"
 target="_blank">My WebSpace</a> - a web service, which provides a personal web 
            content storage (i.e Internet Disk, Web-hard) </li>
          <li><a href="http://www.peercom.co.kr/english/product_3.htm"
 target="_blank">Shared WebSpace</a> - a community web service, members can create 
            their own groups and share their contents by shared webspace (Internet 
            group storage )</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Benefits of these services are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can access personal remote PCs and use data with IE (Internet Explorer) 
            or Peercom's own desktop program. </li>
          <li>Can replicate personal data (Files, Folder, MP3, Photos, Images, 
            E-mail, Address, Bookmark..) between PCs and work with latest data 
            at any PC </li>
          <li> Can store personal data at Internet storage (webspace) and share 
            that data with others. </li>
          <li> Can make any PC as a personal homepage server. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Members can get to their WebSpace and Shared WebSpace from a web browser 
          and also directly from "<a
 href="http://www.peercom.co.kr/english/product.htm">My DeskStation</a>." Features 
          of the Peercom service are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to install / use without complicate network setting. </li>
          <li>Connect an individual's PCs, PDA, Mobile phones, etc. </li>
          <li>Share digital data with any digital devices with no waiting period. 
          </li>
          <li> Home PC can be used as a homepage web server. </li>
          <li>DCRL( Digital Content Resource Locator) can address any PC's resources 
            such file, movie, photo, mp3, etc</li>
          <li>Custom-built service<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"My Personal Portal" uses JXTA as a communication protocol between 
          devices such as PCs and mobile phone. During initial design of their 
          product, Peercom reviewed other P2P technologies such as Groove Networks 
          or Gnutella. They soon found many limitations to use them as a standard 
          platform for various P2P applications. These issues focused their development 
          team on using JXTA Technology, which shortened the required product 
          development time (although there were some bugs found). </p>
        <p>A key factor in the decision is the network independance which makes 
          the communication between peers possible in any network environment. 
          JXTA Technology gives more and more clear meanings in networking where 
          presently most PCs use Firewall, NAT, or Dynamic IP. JXTA Technology 
          also improves development productivity for network-enabled applications. 
          This supports many types of devices, and the implementation in other 
          device environment such as PDA, cell phones, etc. has gotten much simpler. 
          Selecting JXTA Technology shortened the time needed for developing their 
          new product. </p>
        <p>Other technologies used to develop "My Personal Portal" are XML-based 
          Personal Repository, J2SE, Combride, JXTA-based P2P, Peercom's own P2P 
          Protocol, etc. Other Sun technologies currently used include JAVA, JNI 
          to develop a portal for web interfaces. </p>
        <p>The version 0.9 alpha release of "My Personal Portal" will be released 
          on 8 March, 2004. A short English-language demo service will be available 
          mid-March 2004.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Peercom is also working on a mobile P2P project based upon JXTA Technologies. 
          This work is being done for SK Telecom, which is currently one of the 
          largest mobile telecommunication company in South Korea. The pilot of 
          Mobile P2P is currently underway.</p>
        <p>Peercom developers believe that P2P best applies to embedded devices 
          rather than on general PCs. They expect that JXTA will be the choice 
          for the platform of ubiquitous computing in the future. By porting JXTA-C 
          with Phone OS as a starter, they strive to become the expert company 
          in the field of ubiquitous middleware platform technology by applying 
          JXTA in various embedded devices.</p>
        <p><b>Other JXTA Activities:</b> Peercom has been hosting the <a
 href="http://jxtakorea.net/">Korean JXTA forum</a> for 2 years now. They are 
          the only Korean company publically involved in JXTA research. The Peercom 
          development team also participates in "Tcp Transport" and "Rendezvous 
          Service" tasks by participating in the jxta-c "Borabora" project (Jxta-C 
          2.x Implementation).</p>

          The Automated Network Services (ANS) is a web-based server that provides 
          software updates to network appliances, including Nokia Message Protector.<br>
        </p>
        <p>ANS is a distributed server, installed at different sites around the 
          world. ANS uses JXTA to communicate between the individually installed 
          machines. In effect, every ANS machine is a peer in a peergroup. It 
          is easy to add an additional server; using JXTA advertisements and discovery 
          service, the new server will locate and join the peergroup. ANS uses 
          JXTA sockets to communicate data events within the system. ANS performs 
          its database replication and synchronization using the JXTA socket.<br>
        </p>
        <p> During the requirements definition phase of ANS, several requirements 
          made JXTA the obvious choice. The ability to provide flexible network 
          topologies for the installation of ANS at different sites. Using JXTA, 
          they can configure the ports and protocol used to get through existing 
          firewalls so that sites can communicate. Using JXTA, nodes can be easily 
          added and removed. JXTA provides the network communication layer. And, 
          since they are already Java programmers, the learning curve was that

        <p>The team's vision for JXTA and P2P is Web services with 100% up-time, 
          affordable, any time, anywhere. They believe that P2P will commoditize 
          the availability and scalability aspects of online operations, by delivering 
          a platform where applications are truly decentralized and ubiquitous. 
          Instead of spending a huge amount of resources up-front, P2P will allow 
          businesses to grow its IT operations on demand, yet still providing 
          a secure and high-available infrastructure.<br>

        based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, provides tools for agent-based distributed 
        computing. The tools are used by system integrators and corporations for 
        integration of business processes, supply chain, web and wireless, and 
        in other areas requiring complex business integration. 
        <p> Agents are autonomous and adaptive software components, providing 
          rich, flexible services. A multi-agent system architecture allows you 
          to break up complexity into relatively simple agents, and therefore, 
          relatively simple relationships between the agents. Because the agents 
          are adaptive, location-independent and loosely coupled, Tryllian's agent-based 
          systems are extremely flexible and easy to upgrade and change. This 
          agent-based architecture, together with Tryllian's tools enable rapid 
          and low-impact integration of distributed, multi-platform, heterogeneous 
          systems that work across organizations and along the supply chain. </p>
        <p> Tryllian uses JXTA technology for communication between agents (i.e., 
          between components of a system), next to JMS and Web Services. JXTA 
          protocols are used for the transport of agents across a dynamic network. 
          JXTA protocols are also the key for agents to find their way in a network. 
          On top of JXTA technology, Tryllian provides a custom-built agent security 
          infrastructure based on TLS. </p>
        <p> Tryllian uses standardized components and technologies where possible. 
          Using JXTA and Java technologies has allowed Tryllian to concentrate 
          on its core business: building tools and infrastructure for distributed 
          multi-agent systems. Tryllian sees decentralized architectures as key 
          in achieving the next-level of computing interoperability. </p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.kappie.com">Clay International</a> is a small 
          IT consulting firm that designs and develops software solutions for 
          clients in various industries such as banking, utilities, and airlines. 
          They developed Kappie as a way to learn some new technologies and have 
          some fun. </p>
        <p>Kappie is an information manager that lets you create, download, organize 
          and share virtually any kind of digital data. It works by passing items 
          from person to person. When you share an item, you can see how many 
          people have received it and how they have rated it. Kappie is a unique 
          product that combines elements from some of today's most popular applications: 
          email, file sharing, instant messaging, weblogs, and social networks. 
        </p>
        <p>Kappie uses the JXTA-C implementation as the foundation for its transport 
          layer, as well as to manage user presence. Protocols used include discovery, 
          rendezvous, and pipe binding. They chose JXTA mostly because of the 
          fact that it is open source, which ensures a rigorous level of peer 
          review and allows for customization. Since Kappie is written in C++, 
          it was a requirement that their P2P library have a C/C++ interface. 
          Most importantly, since JXTA is non-proprietary and is maintained by 
          a large community of developers rather than a single company, Clay developers 
          believe it has great potential to become a standard technology on which 
          many interoperable applications will be built. </p>
        <p>Prior to undertaking this development, they considered Jabber, Joltid, 
          Gnutella, and Groove, but none of these alternatives had all the benefits 
          of JXTA described above. Additionally, Kappie was developed on a very 
          tight budget, so the most practical benefit was that it was free! Other 
          than that, having a peer group of knowledgeable developers to interact 
          with and draw knowledge from was hugely valuable to the development 
          team. </p>
        <h3>Vision for P2P and JXTA </h3>
        <p>Many people are excited about P2P because it has the potential to fulfill 
          the long-promised notion of allowing anyone to become an information 
          producer, rather than just a consumer. To date, this worthy goal has 
          been hampered by several problems: market fragmentation and incompatible 
          technologies; simplistic applications that only support one mode of 
          communication; and legal issues over copyright protection. JXTA, with 
          its open protocols and rich set of services, offers solutions to the 
          first two problems. </p>
        <p>Kappie is one of the first applications to demonstrate that P2P is 
          about more than chatting and sharing bootleg music. The power of many-to-many 
          computing should be leveraged to help people find each other, share 
          their thoughts and expertise, solve problems more quickly, and express 
          themselves creatively. JXTA enables all of these things, but no "killer 
          application" has yet emerged to take advantage of its massive scalability. 
          They hope that Kappie and other applications targeted at the mass market 
          will help propel JXTA to the front of the P2P pack. </p>

        <p><a href="http://www.morganspenserconsulting.com/index.html">Morgan 
          Spenser Consulting</a>, of London, United Kingdom, provides organizations 
          with consultancy and research services relating to distributed-computing 
          technologies. </p>
        <p>Morgan Spenser Consulting defines distributed computing to include 
          any system that utilizes more than one physical computer to perform 
          tasks in a single application. Systems from simple client-server installations 
          made up of tens of machines, to large-scale P2P networks with millions 
          of connected machines, all fall under the title of distributed computing 
          technology. Distributed computing has grown chaotically since its birth 
          and now includes many and varied different protocols, interfaces and 
          implementations. This can be confusing for both newcomers and professionals 
          trying to negotiate the maze of details required to understand these 
          systems and cause many to underestimate the complexities involved in 
          making these systems work well. </p>
        <p>Morgan Spenser Consulting has in-depth experience of working in high-pressure 
          software development environments; designing, building, supporting and 
          upgrading distributed computing systems. Specifically, services include 
          the provision of consultancy, project management or development resources 
          for organizations wishing to utilise distributed computing technology. 
          These involve the use of a wide range of tools, languages and methodologies 
          of which Morgan Spenser Consulting considers some of the most important 
          to be; Java, Jini, J2EE, J2ME, JXTA, Grids, wireless communications, 
          design patterns, eXtreme and agile programming and open-source development.</p>
        <p>Morgan Spenser Consulting uses JXTA technology because it provides 
          a secure, open and scalable framework that allows applications to interact 
          efficiently in large-scale networks. Using JXTA technology, Morgan Spenser 
          Consulting can design and build systems that work seamlessly across 
          a variety of network environments. Also, due to its open-source nature, 
          JXTA has proved to be an invaluable tool for research into new ideas 
          in P2P networking and best practices, in terms of design and development 
          strategies. Part of Morgan Spenser Consulting's research involves helping 
          to develop the <a
 href="http://go.jxta.org/">go project</a> in order to explore the dynamics of 
          tournaments in P2P networks. The solution to this problem will be applicable 
          to many different business and organizational needs.</p>
        <p>Morgan Spenser Consulting believes that JXTA technology will act as 
          a stepping-stone to many new ideas and developments in the area of distributed 
          computer technology. In conjunction with this, Morgan Spenser Consulting 
          recognises that P2P networking will continue to grow over the next few 
          years, becoming more popular and more widely used by computer engineers. 
          This will allow organizations to provide scalable solutions for a variety 
          of problem areas. P2P will expand from its base in media sharing and 
          chat applications to become a technology that is utilized in all areas 
          of operations. JXTA technology forms a preferred route for this growth 
          by fostering both open standards and community involvement.</p>
        <p>David Savage, managing director at Morgan Spenser Consulting, has been 
          involved with Project JXTA since April 2001. He has been active on the 
          mailing lists, helped out with several projects including the <a href="http://platform.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">Java

          is a Milwaukee software development company specializing in Web-based 
          software solutions fully tailored to meet the needs of businesses in 
          all industries. Brevient&#8217;s Web conferencing center and peer-to-peer 
          (P2P) sharing solution, <a
 href="http://www.brevient.com/insidePages/products.brevientconnect.description.php3">Brevient 
          Connect</a>, aids in customer relationship management, coalescing visual, 
          audio and data information into meetings and reports, and enhancing 
          sales pipelines. </p>
        <p> Brevient Connect was written for the J2EE platform and illustrates 
          key concepts of JXTA's open protocol technology. JXTA&#8217;s core functionality 
          maximizes P2P and group interactions in a secure environment independent 
          of operating system, development language and network transport employed 
          by each peer. </p>
        <p> Brevient elected to use JXTA as its foundation protocol because it 
          imparts the functionality required in the creation and implementation 
          of a successful P2P sharing and Web conferencing tool. With rapid increases 
          in the prevalence of Web-based applications and P2P networking, the 
          uniform resource addressing, self-organized domains and spontaneous 
          resource discovery of the JXTA framework will be essential to product 
          development. JXTA&#8217;s standard development methodology follows suit 
          with industry standards without limiting future growth, allowing for 
          incredible flexibility in developing Brevient Connect and the ability 
          for users to form robust, independent P2P networks. </p>
        <p> With the extensive collaboration opportunities and reduced network 
          congestion offered by JXTA, Brevient continues to enrich the component 
          architecture of Brevient Connect. Integration of remote control navigation 
          and operation and voice operated data conferencing will grant users 
          added freedom in P2P activities and interoffice conferencing. Incorporation 
          of these components will enable Brevient Connect users to further optimize 
          performance and capitalize on emerging state-of-the-art technologies. 
        </p>
        <p> Brevient initiated development utilizing the JXTA platform in August 
          2003 after preliminary field research indicated that JXTA technology 
          was the most adaptable, fundamentally sound environment upon which Brevient 
          Connect could be constructed. Brevient expects to be actively involved 
          in the development of more JXTA community projects during 2004. </p>

        Software Ltd</a>, headquarted in Brighton, UK is a leading specialist 
        in evolutionary computing, providing products and services for business, 
        scientific and engineering optimization across a broad range of industry 
        sectors. Codefarm's products include a platform for peer-to-peer distributed 
        processing, and an integrated toolkit providing a sophisticated development 
        environment, job management and scientific visualization facilities. 
        <p> The Codefarm AI Platform has been designed to tackle difficult non-linear 
          optimization problems. Able to harness the unused processing power of 
          any number of networked computers, it solves large-scale combinatorial 
          problems involving uncertainty, complex constraints and multiple objectives. 
          The computational technologies supported by the Codefarm AI Platform 
          can be broadly termed "evolutionary optimization", "soft computing" 
          or "artificial life" because many of the underlying techniques employ 
          methods inspired by the processes and outcomes of biological evolution 
          in nature. These techniques include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, 
          neural networks, simulated annealing and hybrid algorithms. </p>
        <p> Widespread adoption of these technologies has been hindered partly 
          because applying AI techniques to real problems is difficult, requiring 
          a great deal of expert knowledge and skill; and partly because evolutionary 
          optimization is too computationally intensive for a single desktop computer, 
          whilst traditional distributed systems frameworks, grid systems and 
          cluster computing approaches have high fixed costs and deployment and 
          administration overhead. </p>
        <p> The Codefarm AI Platform takes a peer-to-peer approach to distributed 
          computing, using JXTA techology for all its underlying network infrastructure. 
          The ad hoc, decentralized, and self-organizing character of peer-to-peer 
          architectures dramatically reduces deployment and management costs relative 
          to traditional distributed computing techniques, whilst enabling non-disruptive 
          reuse of existing computing resources. The platform is optimized for 
          a range of scenarios: from desktop PCs within one or more organizations 
          or at large on the Internet, to dedicated server farms and clusters. 
          Codefarm believes that P2P in general and JXTA in particular isn't just 
          "cool geek stuff", but is practical, applicable and ready for prime 
          time. </p>
        <p> Codefarm began evaluating JXTA in August 2002 as the underlying communication 
          infrastructure for its products and found it to be an extremely flexible 
          technology, embodying a powerful set of abstractions for peer-to-peer 
          systems which are ideally suited to their needs. Codefarm is now actively 
          implementing the technology and participating in the Project JXTA community 
          represented by Miles Sabin, Chief Scientist, Distributed Systems. Miles 
          has committed bugfixes against the core platform, and Codefarm intends 
          to contribute code to the community. Codefarm has built a number of 
          peer group services which address issues that are particularly relevant 
          in distributed computing and grid-like applications of JXTA, in particular 
          a matchmaker; a scheduler; a role-based security model; a leader election 
          protocol; a code distribution framework; and lightweight distributed 
          state management. </p>

        Peer-to-Peer framework for distributed, multi platform data access, visualization, 
        reporting and file exchange. Their product suite, VistaPoint, helps optimize 
        business processes by providing ability for unified visualization, linking, 
        and reporting of data and information assembled from dispersed sources 
        through the use of a distributed virtual repository, data access, charting 
        and reporting tools. 
        <p> VistaPoint is based on VistaRepository, a distributed directory of 
          resources located on multiple peer computers.&nbsp; It is built on a 
          concept of a peer group (or Distributed Working Area) where every peer, 
          large or small, can be part of a peer group and contribute information 
          that becomes a part of a &#8220;virtual&#8221; repository. VistaPoint 
          is based on pure Java technology and open standards such as J2EE, JXTA, 
          and XML. VistaPoint architecture is based on five distinct layers that 
          directly correspond to the standard ISO OSI Layers: Application Layer, 
          Vista Services Layer, Vista Core Layer (peer group and repository), 
          and Transport Layer. VistaPoint includes three API&#8217;s that allow 
          easy integration of custom applications and services into VistaPoint 
          environment: Application Layer API, DWA API(peer group and repository 
          API), and Transport Layer API. </p>
        <p> VistaPoint is using JXTA as a foundation for its transport layer. 
          Currently, they are using JXTA implementation of the following protocols: 
          peer revolver, endpoint routing, rendezvous, peer information and peer 
          discovery protocol. VistaPortal believes that JXTA provides the most 
          advanced open platform foundation for our product that requires network, 
          platform, and device independence as well as wireless access capabilities.

          to easily share their knowledge using a peer-2-peer (p2p) network.</p>
        <p>Content providers of the Science-To-Science (S2S) service will install 
          S2S Provider Peers on their workstations and workgroup servers. These 
          peers gather locally accessible information automatically according 
          to the wishes of the providers. Amongst others, local filespace, databases, 
          Web sites in intranets as well as FTP servers can be scanned. The S2S 
          Provider Peers maintain a local index of the fulltext and metadata of 
          all scientific documents found. Via S2S Hub Peers, the super-peers of 
          the network, search and download requests of users will reach the provider. 
          Users will search for, browse and download information using S2S Consumer 
          Peers.</p>
        <p>While certain aspects of the Science-To-Science service are specifically 
          designed for the needs of the science community, the system can also 
          be deployed in organisations and commercial companies operating in multiple 
          regions or countries. The system provides an intelligent information 
          backbone required for efficient knowledge management.</p>
        <p>Science-To-Science implements the <a
 href="http://search.jxta.org/JXTAsearch.pdf">JXTA Search specification</a> and 
          extends various conceptual as well as technical aspects: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>As the S2S Provider Peers automatically scan various local datasources 
            for new or updated documents researchers will not need to adapt their 
            normal workflow of editing and publishing scientific information. 
            Combining this with locally managed fulltext indexes a much higher 
            up-to-dateness and completeness can be achieved than is possible with 
            traditional centralized approaches.</li>
          <li>S2S Hub Peers also aggregate search results sent by the S2S Provider 
            Peers and automatically remove duplicate hits. Aggregated search results 
            are cached and completed with late-arriving results to enhance and 
            speed up subsequent searches.</li>
          <li>S2S Hub Peers orchestrate a p2p exchange of neighbour term indices 
            so that over time a global picture of the location of data arises 
            in the network. S2S Hub Peers will thus <i>learn</i> to route queries 
            prioritized to those providers that will return the best results. 
            Additionally, by statistically evaluating search and download requests 
            content providers trying to spam the system will automatically be 
            detected and removed from the network.</li>
          <li>S2S Consumer Peers have been implemented as Java clients for local 
            installation and use on mobile devices. A web based S2S Consumer Peer 
            allows for search and download using a normal web browser without 
            the need to install any special software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the heart of the Science-To-Science system, various software components 
          from neofonie's regular product line execute the primary algorithmic 
          chores. Integrated into the S2S Provider Peers, <a
 href="http://www.neofonie.de/loesungen/search/robot.csp">neofonie search:robot</a> 
          gathers information from various types of sources, converts a number 
          of document formats into the XML format used internally and applies 
          various content filters. Integrated into S2S Provider Peers and S2S 
          Hub Peers, <a
 href="http://www.neofonie.de/loesungen/search/engine.csp">neofonie search:engine</a> 
          is used as a high performance XML content repository with support for 
          fulltext and parametric search.</p>
        <p>The development of the Science-To-Science service is funded by <a
 href="http://www.bmbf.de/en/index.php3">BMBF</a> (Federal Ministry of Education 
          and Research) and <a
 href="http://www.dfn.de/index.jsp?path=/welcometodfn/">DFN</a> (German Research 
          Network Association). DFN is a non-profit association providing high-performance 
          networking infrastructure and services for the research and education 
          community in Germany. The JXTA based Science-To-Science service will 
          run as a service on top of the G-WiN (Gigabit Network for Science), 
          the very-high-bandwith Internet backbone connecting research institutions 
          throughout Germany. G-WiN is the German contribution to the <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/">Internet 
          2</a> initiative.</p>
        <p>neofonie's involvement with Project JXTA started officially on April 
          1, 2002. They have been involved in the community on the mailing lists 
          and in the board elections. Further involvement is expected in the JXTA 
          Search Project, as they are researching this technology at the moment. 
          neofonie started the development of Science-To-Science using version 
          1.0 of the JXTA platform but is in the process of switching to version 
          2.1 due to the enhanced scalability of the implementation.</p>
        <p>neofonie strongly believes that p2p and JXTA are here to stay. Combinations 
          of classical and p2p applications are going to be the fabric of future 
          networking. The immense computational potential extant in networks today 
          demands more efficient utilization. JXTA is P2P made easy and universally 
          applicable. neofonie sees JXTA growing into a mature standard supplementing 
          IPv6 to cater for decentralized connectivity.</p>
        <p>Currently the <a href="http://s2s.neofonie.de/team.jsp">Science-To-Science 
          Team</a> is looking for workgroups and individuals in the German research 
          and education community that are interested in testing the service and 
          providing feedback as the project reaches its Beta phase, which will 
          last from July until the end of the year. The <a
 href="http://s2s.neofonie.de/anmeldung.jsp">call for participation</a> in the 
          beta-testing programme issued in late June has already resulted in several 
          hundred registrations, many from noteworthy German research and technology 
          institutions. From the beginning of 2004, the S2S network will be publicly 
          accessible via web browser for search and download purposes. However, 
          only registered users will be able to insert their information into 
          the network.</p>

        <p> The <a
 href="http://www.naconline.comhttp://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/default.htm">National 
          Association of Convenience Stores</a> (NACS) is an industry trade association 
          representing over 2,000 convenience retailers operating over 100,000 
          stores worldwide. Among NACS many functions, it has technical working 
          groups creating an industry-wide specification for the convenience stores 
          of the future. The Open Site Architecture technical committee of NACS 
          selected JXTA technology as their connectivity standard for the devices 
          in the smart convenience store of the future. </p>
        <p> JXTA technology will connect all the devices in the convenience store 
          such as the fuel-level sensors, gasoline dispensers, point-of-sale (POS) 
          terminals, and car wash controllers in a secure manner using open standards. 
          These devices come from many different manufacturers. JXTA technology 
          enables NACS members to deploy low-cost, open, standards-based networks 
          in their convenience stores to connect devices from many manufacturers, 
          with no single point of failure.</p>
        <p> Convenience store owners will benefit because it will be easier for 
          them to implement solutions. They will save money by building to one 
          standard, as opposed to diverse platforms. </p>
        <p> One example of savings would is the equipment required for tank gauge 
          monitoring. Today each tank gauge monitor is hooked up to its own modem 
          to reporting leaks or high-water problems. Being able to put this function 
          onto an Open Site Architecture network means that a tank can be part 
          of a peer group and notify people through a pager or a cell phone. The 
          retailer is thus able to remove a modem and a phone line that are no 
          longer needed.</p>
        <p> Another scenario... a retailer has ten stores and he wants to change 
          the price of gasoline at all of them. He can create a peer group from 
          his home office that includes the price sign, the fueling dispensers, 
          and the POS. And he can send out the new price to the fuel dispensers 
          and get confirmation that the prices have been changed. He can do that 
          from a home office to all ten stores.</p>
        <p> Sun Microsystems has been actively involved in helping with this standard 
          as has several of the device manufactureres: <a

        <p> <a href="http://www.globalinfotek.com">Global InfoTek, Inc.</a> (GITI), 
          is a leading-edge information systems engineering and integration company. 
          They use Java, C#, Jini, JXTA, and .NET technologies to experiment and 
          build distributed applications. Using these advanced distributed computing 
          technologies, they build and integrate intelligent agents that span 
          the enterprise and leverage the Internet to provide organizations with 
          new capabilities.</p>
        <p> GITI uses the JXTA peer group model to enable Peer-to-Peer Knowledge 
          and Information Discovery (P2PKID) and self-organization in multi-agent 
          systems. Multi-agent protocols enable agent peer groups to create and 
          share plans for collaboration, such as decomposing queries and aggregating 
          results. The JXTA model provides a direct and robust implementation 
          path for testing new ideas and experimenting with new approaches to 
          virtual collaboration in the enterprise. </p>
        <p> They chose JXTA because it is a leading edge P2P framework with a 
          large open source community of developers. The JXTA layered protocol 
          architecture provides flexibility in the design and implementation of 
          applications. </p>
        <p> GITI's vision is to extend the notion of P2P data sharing, which has 
          demonstrated itself to be a disruptive and revolutionary technology, 
          to P2P knowledge sharing in virtual collaborative environments where 
          users share files seamlessly and securely.</p>
        <p> Brian Sayrs, Principal Scientist of GITI, helped start the Bench project 
          to begin understanding and evaluating performance issues associated 
          with P2P systems. He also helped create the "Hyperchat" program that 
          built upon previous JXTA applications and Java components, including 
          Chat, <a
 href="http://jxme.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JXTA for J2ME (JXME project)</a>, 
          and JMF to deliver multimedia content links in chat sessions to portable 
          devices.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> GITI's mission is to design and build innovative, affordable, high 
          quality, component-based information systems - specializing in exploiting 
          and integrating advanced products and technologies. For more information

        <p> The Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
          (JPL) in Pasadena, California, managed by the California Institute of 
          Technology, is NASA's lead center for the robotic exploration of our 
          solar system. In furthering their mission to explore space, they transfer 
          technology towards solving problems here on Earth as well. </p>
        <p>Their software makes possible the unification of data collected from 
          the Mars Odyssey spacecraft and will be used to support data distribution 
          for several future planetary missions. Further, the same software is 
          correlating cancer biomarkers on a project called the Early Detection 
          Research Network. Under the aegis of the National Institutes of Health, 
          researchers are using metadata, data, and peer-to-peer networking to 
          learn how to combat one of our species's most potent killers: cancer. 
        </p>
        <p>Object Oriented Data Technology combines a metadata model with a software 
          middleware to enable the creation of virtual databases from datasets 
          across the nation. Scientists and other researchers can make discoveries 
          using different datasets produced by different organizations with different 
          meanings, as if they were a single, large repository of knowledge. </p>
        <p>JPL's DataService uses JXTA technology and adds an additional capability: 
          resolution of resources given a query, and retrieval of those resources. 
          Using an open-ended metadata model based on the Dublin Core and ISO-11179, 
          users can query an entire peerspace for scientific data, whether it's 
          astrophysical, planetary, biological, medicinal, administrative, engineering, 
          or otherwise. </p>
        <p>JXTA technology provided just the solution towards solving the challenges 
          presented by outmoded client/server technology: by turning the entire 
          architecture on its head. Making every component in the system both 
          a client and a server means decentralizing adminsitration and removing 
          points of failure. </p>
        <p>The Object Oriented Data Technology task hopes to deploy JXTA-based 
          solutions throughout the nation and raise the awareness of the benefits 
          of the P2P model. They envision that, by making a JXTA data service 
          easy to use, unprecedented numbers of scientists and engineers can join 
          in a peer group's total research effort, leading towards the greater 
          accessibility and distribution of data, and earlier and more frequent 
          scientific discoveries. </p>
        <p>The Object Oriented Data Technology includes team members who contribute 
          directly and indirectly to Project JXTA. One of our major developers 
          has been involved with JXTA since 2001 as a committer and a project 
          owner. </p>

          company is providing tailored products and services across a broad range 
          of enterprises. Zudha is extensively involved in research activities 
          on emerging as well as proven technologies to realize next generation 
          products.</p>
        <p> One of Zudha's products <a href="http://zimpro.zudha.com/">ZIM-Pro</a> 
          which is a Peer-to-Peer Instant Messenger developed purely using JXTA 
          protocols uses the endpoint messenger and JXTA socket concept for identifying 
          peers &amp; initiating chat and file share irrespective to the location 
          on the Internet. The Rendezvous peers across Internet aids in building 
          a virtual peer-to-peer network for faster and more efficient flow of 
          messages through it. Another variant of ZIM-Pro called RBIM is a role 
          based Instant messenger suitable for hierarchy based exchange of messages 
          within the enterprise or customers/partners. </p>
        <p>Zudha is researching and developing Customer Support Components (CSC) 
          to run on Java, and C implementations of JXTA which can be easily plugged 
          into any software product written in these languages. The CSCs would 
          provide the users of the software a peer-to-peer environment to interact 
          with other users of the product and find answers for their support requests. 
          This would minimize the load on centralized customer support teams thereby 
          reducing response time for support calls. Users would learn from their 
          peers who are using the same product thereby adding value to the product. 
        </p>
        <p> Zudha is closely associated with evolution of JXTA technology and 
          is actively supporting the JXTA Special Interest group at Bangalore. 
          Zudha has a vision of setting up a JXTA/Peer-to-Peer computing competency 
          center at Bangalore to provide extensive support to develop JXTA-C and 
          JXTA-Embedded RTOS platforms, while providing application development 
          expertise in Peer-to-Peer computing. </p>
        <p> According to Zudha, JXTA is the only initiative in peer-to-peer computing 
          platform which is driven by open source participation and adheres to 
          a Documented Specification which could be submitted to a standards body. 
          Backed by pioneers and innovators in the information networking industry 
          like Sun Microsystems, JXTA has become the de facto choice of any business 
          case where peer-to-peer communication is deemed fit. </p>

        These technologies are implemented by using Java, JXTA, Tomcat, Jini, 
        Xindice. 
        <p> JXTA is the main communication channel for collaboration among Ifreestyle 
          users. The piping technology of JXTA is used to broadcast or exchanges 
          messages within a specific group of peers in a secure and reliable manner. 
          The rendezvous service of JXTA is applied to develop a manageable private 
          network of peers. The relay Service of JXTA has provided the ability 
          for Ifreestyle to support customers who are beyond firewalls. </p>
        <p> The open and flexible framework of JXTA has made it possible for Ifreestyle 
          to integrate its own technologies with JXTA easily, including mechanisms 
          for real-time event notification, online and offline database synchronization, 
          distributed search, and detection of member presence. JXTA also provides 
          ability for Ifreestyle to be deployed easily in various devices such 
          as mobile phones, PDAs, and navigation systems. </p>
        <p> Digital Dream sees JXTA as a reliable and promising implementation 
          for P2P networks, providing various services for different needs. The 
          different features of JXTA are outstanding: cross-device, distributed 
          architecture, cross-platform, flexibility, and open source features. 
        </p>
        <p> Ifreestyle developers participate actively in JXTA projects. They 
          test the performance of JXTA networks in extensible and large peer networks, 
          and share the results with JXTA community. </p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.bbn.com">BBN Technologies</a> of Arlington, VA, 
          is an innovative R&amp;D company, providing both advanced research and 
          custom, research-based solutions for its customers. The Sensor Systems 
          and Technologies Group at BBN is currently involved in a research project 
          to apply JXTA and agent-based computing to the coordination of fields 
          of sensors and robots. Their focus is on military applications, but 
          the core technology is applicable to many domains such as energy control 
          systems and infrastructure protection. </p>
        <p> Currently, the military deploys fields of sensors to remotely monitor 
          areas for some activity. These sensors include things like motion sensors 
          around the perimeter of a base that can detect intruders or underwater 
          acoustic sensors that can detect submarines. The data from these sensors 
          are all transmitted to a centralized collection and analysis point. 
          There is an obvious scalability problem, which is that as these fields 
          become very large, the amount of data that can be used is limited by 
          the throughput of the data transmission medium. BBN is using agent-based 
          computing to do effective processing of the raw data at the sensor itself, 
          reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. </p>
        <p> JXTA is used for communications of higher-level information between 
          the sensors, so they can take advantage of other sensors' observations 
          without requiring a fully-connected, high-bandwidth network. Along with 
          JXTA, BBN is using the Cougaar agent architecture to develop prototypes. 
          Cougaar is an, open-source, 100% Java architecture, so it's a good match 
          for JXTA. Integration is easy because Cougaar has a plug-in architecture 
          that lets BBN add JXTA communications without requiring modifications 
          to Cougaar's native communications mechanism. JXTA allows them to use 
          a more flexible model of communications based on peer groups in addition 
          to Cougaar's point-to-point model. </p>
        <p> BBN needed a way for the sensors and robots to advertise their capabilities 
          and interests so that relationships for data sharing could emerge dynamically 
          based on the conditions that the sensors experienced. They saw JXTA 
          as a way to add these peer-to-peer communications to BBN's software 
          agent applications. They also needed to use a technology that used open 
          standards like XML, had a solid open-source implementation, and a good 
          Java binding without requiring all peers to be implemented in Java. 
        </p>
        <p> BBN's work with JXTA technology began in the Fall of 2001 and was 
          presented at JavaOne March 2002 and June 2003. This is a long-term research 
          project that BBN hopes to be building on for years. More information 
          about this project is available at <a href="http://www.bbn.com/sip/ssw.html">www.bbn.com/sip/ssw.html</a>

          CT SE2 (Corporate Technology, Software &amp; Architectures) is a department 
          within Siemens AG that focuses on architectures in the area of Mobile, 
          Embedded and Distributed Systems. Working on the edge of technology 
          on one side and being close to Siemens Business Divisions on another 
          allows CT SE2 to bring innovation to Siemens products. </p>
        <p> The goal of the CT SE2 project was to provide a proof of concept for 
          P2P networking, and for this, they used JXTA as the P2P-platform. Siemens 
          has implemented an "Ad-hoc Awareness" application that allows mobile 
          users to find people and required resources, such as devices and services, 
          in an ad-hoc, spontaneous way. The application runs on the Siemens SIMpad 
          mobile device using WLAN connectivity in the 802.11 ad-hoc mode, which 
          means that no centralized access point is required. Network resources 
          are found in a fully decentralized fashion based on profiles that are 
          stored directly on mobile devices, the resource providers. </p>
        <p> JXTA provides fundamental functionality for P2P networking, and it 
          is designed as a framework allowing for building applications on top 
          of it. Therefore, the "Ad-hoc Awareness" application is built on top 
          of the JXTA platform that enables features such as discovery and messaging 
          mechanism in a fully decentralized environment. Based on these features 
          CT SE2 has implemented an application that puts intelligence to the 
          end devices, enables communication in the ad-hoc mobile environment 
          and provides a nomadic community support. </p>
        <p> The Siemens group chose the JXTA framework because it provides all 
          the necessary building blocks such as peer, peer groups, discovery, 
          service, etc. for implementation of a P2P application. This speeds-up 
          the development work. In addition, JXTA is becoming an open standard 
          for P2P networking that will certainly increase the value of JXTA-enabled 
          devices. P2P has become a synonym of efficient use of network resources 
          and flexibility. P2P ideas are here to stay and will spread in the future 
          from the personal communication area to the area of industrial, embedded 
          and sensors-based scenarios. </p>
        <p> CT SE2's official involvement in JXTA-Core project started in January 
          2002. They have contributed a JXTA-port to mobile devices running Win 
          CE operating system and Java Personal Edition VM to the JXTA-community. 
          The contributed version of JXTA enables P2P-networking with mobile devices, 
          such as Tablet PCs and PDAs, and these devices talking to desktops and 
          mobile phones. They demonstrated "Ad-hoc Awareness" at JavaOne 2002.

          Technologies Private Limited</a>, based in Chennai, India, offers system 
          software development services, contract research and development and 
          platform products for embedded systems development. </p>
        <p> Sankhya's products include SANKHYA Varadhi, a standards compliant 
          object middleware framework for distributed systems development. SANKHYA 
          is using JXTA as a platform for doing basic research into identity in 
          distributed systems. In particular, SANKHYA's work is aimed at developing 
          a standard for an identity service where the identified prinicipal has 
          maximum control over the information the Principal wants to share with 
          other entities in the distributed system. </p>
        <p> An example of one of Sankhya's projects is the following: A Varadhi 
          CORBA Client application invokes a request on a sample CORBA server. 
          The CORBA Server receives identification information from the CORBA 
          Client, that includes a Client identification string (E-mail ID) and 
          a PeerId. The CORBA server then assumes the role of a JXTA client and 
          sends out a message to Authenticate the Identity. A successful response 
          from the Server JXTA Peer (CORBA Client) is used by the CORBA server 
          as sufficient (basic) Authentication of the Client's Identity. </p>
        <p> In a more general case, the Client Peer and the Server Peer can exist 
          in different Peer Groups with one or more intermediate Peer Groups acting 
          as trusted intermediaries to complete the mutual Identification and 
          Authentication. Current work is focused on defining, requesting or specifying 
          various degrees of Trust and Authentication and the (distributed) maintenance 
          of an Authentication Trail. </p>
        <p> JXTA technology allowed Sankhya to implement and test ideas without 
          having to first build an entire P2P framework. P2P is an essential model 
          for distributed systems development. A large number of transactions 
          on the Internet take place between people, between groups of people 
          or organizations and P2P provides a natural model for developing distributed 
          systems capable of enabling and conducting such transactions. </p>
        <p> Sankhya found that JXTA is simple, yet powerful as it has all the 
          primitives required to implement P2P systems. A Java, C++ or CORBA developer 
          should be able to understand the basic concepts of JXTA and start developing 
          powerful P2P applications within a few days. As the Sankhya research 
          projects mature, they expect to take a more active role in the community. 
          Sankhya plans to place a few demos on the web within the next few weeks

        <p> <a href="http://www.infoglyptic.com">InfoGlyptic Software Pvt Ltd</a>, 
          of Bangalore, India, is a customer driven and quality focused software 
          solutions company covering the entire range of vertical market segments 
          of manufacturing, finance, healthcare, telecom and beyond. </p>
        <p> InfoGlyptic has released DCFS Basic Version, 0.1 Beta, a product that 
          addresses the needs of an Enterprise to leverage shared resources and 
          at the same time utilize the existing network and the extra disc space 
          available on the client nodes thereby reducing the load on a central 
          server. While the DCFS basic version is targeted to be a home/office 
          utility which works completely on peer-to-peer concepts, the Professional 
          and Enterprise editions are deemed as complete enterprise solutions 
          operating without a central server. </p>
        <p> The technology used to develop DCFS-Basic is 100% JXTA and Java technologies. 
          DCFS uses JXTA technology extensively by utilizing all the JXTA protocols 
          in addition to Content Management Service API. New services like EDS, 
          similar to CMS, based on the JXTA platform are also developed to enable 
          remote document editing. Java SWING and IO packages have also been used 
          extensively to make this product efficient. </p>
        <p> InfoGlyptic chose to work with JXTA technology because while other 
          file storage and distribution solutions technologies are heavily dependent 
          on a Central Server, thereby unleashing the threat of Single-Point of 
          failure, JXTA technology tackles the needs of DCFS by providing a de-centralized 
          and peer-to-peer architecture where every node in the network has a 
          role of contributing its best possible sharable resources to the network 
          without compromising on security. </p>
        <p> InfoGlyptic has a strong belief in JXTA technology to emerge as a 
          complimentary technology to every other client-server technology. A 
          future where P2P, and JXTA technology in particular, will play a significant 
          role in P2P Customer Relationship Management, De-Centralized Enterprise 
          Resource Planning and e-Governance where contemporary activities rely 
          heavily on a central data repository. </p>
        <p> InfoGlyptic actively encourages its researchers, architects and developers 
          to keep updated with emerging technologies such as Audio/Video streaming, 
          VXML, with a special emphasis on JXTA Technology. As a result, one of 
          its developers has started and owns a project on JXTA-CAD, an effort 
          to bring the Computer-Aided-Design community under the P2P (JXTA) umbrella.

        <p> 
          <a href="http://www.alberg.com">Alberg Software</a> of Andhra, India, 
          provides next generation business applications, tools, and solutions 
          in the enterprise e-business space. One of Alberg Software's solutions 
          is Hive, a distributed collaborative workspace based on JXTA technology, 
          which will foster collaboration among knowledge workers across organizations. 
          What sets Hive apart from other collaborative platforms is the absence 
          of a central "managed" server for regulating the processes or data storage. 
          Each Hive Client comes equipped with a set of collaboration utilities 
          like "Discussion Boards", "Instant Messaging", "File-sharing", "Calendaring" 
          etc. This enables a knowledge worker to host a discussion using his 
          own machine rather than relying on a central server. </p>
        <p> Web technologies such as markup languages provide rich-user interface 
          environments there by enhancing the user-experience. But overemphasis 
          on browsers and servers has limited the adoption of these technologies 
          for collaboration. Hive tries to remove two factors that hinder adoption 
          of collaborative technology into the business environment. First is 
          the need for a "managed server". The absence of a "managed server" removes 
          administrative roadblocks that hinder small businesses from exploiting 
          the advantages of collaboration technology and knowledge management. 
          Hive uses P2P technology to help the enterprise's network to self-organize. 
          Secondly, by combining a servlet-engine and browser component in each 
          Hive client, Hive includes "write" functionality to the read-only web-technology. 
          The content created by the user will be stored in their machine and 
          by using p2p technologies this content can be shared with others. </p>
        <p> Hive uses JXTA technology as the P2P infrastructure that provides 
          the core services that make up a P2P application. The core services 
          that are provided by JXTA are: Presence, Edge Resources, Identity, and 
          XML-RPC Communication. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <li> Presence: Hive has the ability to tell when a resource is online. 
          Hive uses JXTA to build a buddy list showing which of your colleagues 
          are online. Presence allows for any number of services to be offered 
          to users, such as notification of a business event, once their presence 
          online is established. 
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li> Edge Resources: Most of the content generated by a knowledge worker 
          in his work resides in his own machine. Distributed content management 
          is the technology that helps an organization to collate these content 
          resources from the edges of the network. Hive has added distributed 
          content management functionality to its "TopicMap KnowledgeEngine" over 
          JXTA's distributed content management technology to provide a "distributed 
          TopicMaps" solution, which automates the knowledge collation activity. 
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li> Identity: Enterprise P2P systems have to provide a private network 
          over the public network for collaboration across enterprises. Hive uses 
          JXTA rendezvous functionality to establish "cross-organizational identities" 
          which helps to establish a communication channel across organizations. 
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li> XML-RPC Communication: The core of Hive is a business component, 
          which can receive messages through web forms and also as XML files and 
          respond to them. Hive uses JXTA XML-RPC extensively to establish XML-based 
          communication betweens peers.</li>

          the Oculus CO product. By using JXTA, CO users can find other CO peers 
          and publish and integrate data located on their peers with data distributed 
          over a peer network. </p>
        <p> Oculus chose to work with JXTA technology for a variety of reasons, 
          including JXTA being based on an open architecture with source available, 
          Oculus having an opportunity to leverage existing efforts and technologies, 
          and having an opportunity to contribute to a broad community supported 
          by Sun. </p>
        <p> Oculus' involvement with JXTA includes contributing source code to 
          the JXTA community demonstrating techniques for integrating JXTA into 
          an existing application, as opposed to integrating an existing application 
          into a JXTA shell. </p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.crt.realtors.org">The Center for REALTOR&reg; 
          Technology (CRT)</a> is a department within the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
          OF REALTORS&reg; (NAR) that focuses on providing a voice for REALTORS&reg; 
          with the technology vendors that service them. CRT's mission is to be 
          forward thinking in understanding and assessing the impact of technology 
          on their REALTOR&reg; Membership. </p>
        <p> As the use of the Internet as an information source has grown, the 
          posting of property listing information has become commonplace. Many 
          Web sites that maintain property data allow users to search their listing 
          database for properties of interest. However, listing data is widely 
          distributed; it is (appropriately) in the hands of agents, brokers, 
          MLS's, CIEs, etc. The ability to perform a search for a property requires 
          the site administrator to aggregate the needed data. This type of solution 
          introduces the significant complexity associated with maintaining data 
          retrieved from disparate systems. </p>
        <p> CRT's Ernestine P2P project was born of a desire to eliminate these 
          complexities. The Ernestine solution uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach 
          to the problem of providing property listing search capabilities on 
          the Web. The P2P paradigm allows distributed data sources (databases, 
          XML, spreadsheets, etc.) to participate in a search without the need 
          for the upload of data to a central repository. By allowing owners to 
          maintain their data, updates are reflected immediately making the most 
          current information always available. In addition, information returned 
          as a result of a search is easily linked back to the Web site that represents 
          the data source from which the information was obtained. </p>
        <p> The JXTA framework was chosen because of its open source nature and 
          leadership position in this space. It provides most of the basic functionality 
          necessary for the Ernestine P2P system. Its protocol agnostic design 
          and XML messaging is a natural fit for this solution. This has resulted 
          in reduced development time and allows the solution to be widely distributed 
          at a lower cost. </p>
        <p> Going forward, CRT will continue to investigate the use of this technology 
          to connect widely distributed data sources. P2P technologies have a 
          great potential to lower the cost of doing business for REALTOR&reg; 
          vendors' and in turn lower costs for NAR members. The potential to search 
          several sources of listing data at once, versus site-by-site searches, 
          will be a great efficiency boost for any user of this system. Using 
          P2P technologies, such as JXTA, will allow CRT to contribute significantly 
          to converting this promise to reality. </p>
        <p> The CRT has found JXTA to be a powerful framework that fits in with 
          the vision they have concerning the direction of this technology. They 
          have had great success creating an architecture around it that they 
          believe will make their Ernestine P2P system a success. CRT has gained 
          a great deal of experience that will be shared with the JXTA community 
          in the coming weeks in the form of lessons learned and code releases 
          based on their Ernestine project. They will also make available a demo 
          of the system off of their web page at <a href="http://www.crt.realtors.org">www.crt.realtors.org</a>.

        <p> <a href="http://www.neunetsolutions.com">Neunet Solutions</a> is the 
          premier provider of cross-platform component-based solutions to build 
          Web Services and P2P solutions using Java technologies. They offer products 
          that are readily available for easy customization, installation and 
          integration that will lead their clients to build solutions rapidly 
          and cost effectively. Neunet Solutions&#8217; flagship software, EConExplorer&#8482;, 
          has been successfully developed as the first dynamic content management 
          and distribution solution that has a true J2EE compliant architecture, 
          as well as having successfully implemented JXTA&#8217;s open protocols 
          for P2P web applications. EConExplorer&#8482;&#8217;s content-sharing 
          platform is a cross-platform solution that is based upon web services 
          model, solving the most complex content distributing tasks that enterprises 
          are faced with in today&#8217;s competitive landscape. </p>
        <p> Neunet Solutions successfully implemented JXTA&#8217;s open P2P protocols 
          in June of 2001 into EConExplorer&#8482;&#8217;s content-sharing platform. 
          EConExplorer&#8482; is a P2P web application developed to alleviate 
          the need to build costly custom solutions. It functions as the single 
          entry point into an organization&#8217;s content network, so users never 
          need know where the content they are accessing originated. JXTA&#8217;s 
          Distributed Search Services permits users to logon via EConExplorer&#8482; 
          and locate all information stored in the various repositories found 
          within the content network quickly and easily. This results in the transparency 
          of information transfer for users. A common characteristic of P2P systems 
          is their ability to act as provider and consumer depending on the state 
          of the system. Therefore, EConExplorer&#8482; has a Distributed Search 
          service built on top of JXTA Search Protocol to allow users to transparently 
          locate content in any defined ContentObjects&#8482; (which is referred 
          to as codat in JXTA terminology). By utilizing HTTP protocol, EConExplorer&#8482; 
          nodes can use standard HTTP port, which is widely in use to locate information 
          of interest. </p>
        <p> EConExplorer&#8482;&#8217;s P2P content-sharing platform allows for 
          locating of assets (such as documents in various formats, media files, 
          etc.), and raw data (stored in Legacy Systems, Database Servers, Application 
          Servers, etc) located within or outside of an organization&#8217;s firewall, 
          using a purely web-based front-end, designed to appear and function 
          consistently in many browsers on various platforms. The J2EE standardization 
          allows for role-based accessibility rights to the P2P content network, 
          thereby ensuring that only authorized employees, partners, and affiliates 
          are seeing the content that is critical for performing their daily business 
          tasks. </p>
        <p> For additional information on how EConExplorer&#8482; can alleviate 
          the burden of managing and distributing your organization&#8217;s critical 
          business content please email Love Baladjay at love@neunetsolutions.com,
