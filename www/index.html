<h1>JXTA(TM) Community Projects</h1>
  
<p>You can use JXTA(TM) technology to create peer-to-peer (P2P) applications based 
  on Java technology. JXTA technology is a set of open protocols that enable any 
  connected device on the network, ranging from cell phones and wireless PDAs 
  to PCs and servers, to communicate and collaborate in a P2P manner. JXTA peers 
  create a virtual network where any peer can interact with other peers and resources 
  directly, even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and 
  network address translations (NATs) or on different network transports. </p>

<p>Project JXTA is fortunate to have a strong supportive community.
Come join in the discussions and development efforts. There is such a
wide range of activities to join in on that there is sure to be
something of interest to you! </p>

    
<h3>JXTA COMMUNITY MEMBERS, WE NEED YOUR HELP!</h3>
      
The voting period for the recent JXTA Elections closed Tuesday, June 17th at midnight 
PST. Per the <a href="https://jxta.dev.java.net/voting.htm">JXTA Election Rules</a>, 
it takes 50 votes to certify the election. This number was established years ago 
when the JXTA community was first created. In this election, we received 23 votes. 
After review by the JXTA Board of Directors, it was unanimously agreed that the 
greater JXTA community should determine the status of this election. 
<p>In this effort, we request your vote on the following initiatives:</p>
<p>A. Certify the election results with the submitted 23 votes.<br>
  Note: If initiative A passes, the candidates with the most votes will begin 
  their 2 year term on July 1, 2008.</p>
<p>B. Do not certify the election results with the submitted 23 votes.<br>
  Note: If initiative B passes, the current Board of Directors will remain in 
  term until February 2009 when a new election will be run.</p>
<p>VOTING INSTRUCTIONS<br>
  Please cast your vote to stephanie.kaul@sun.com in the following manner:</p>
<p>* jxta.dev.java.net username<br>
  * Initiative A - +1 OR * Initiative B - +1</p>
<p>Each JXTA Community member gets one vote. The voting period is from today, 
  Monday, June 23rd until Sunday, June 29th at midnight PST. Results will be announced 
  on Monday, June 30th.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help in certifying the JXTA Election. This really is a community 
  effort. Any questions, issues, or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact 
  me at stephanie.kaul@sun.com.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
