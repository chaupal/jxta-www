  <p>You can use Project JXTA technology to create peer-to-peer (P2P) applications 
    based on Java technology. JXTA technology is a set of open protocols that 
    enable any connected device on the network, ranging from cell phones and wireless 
    PDAs to PCs and servers, to communicate and collaborate in a P2P manner. JXTA 
    peers create a virtual network where any peer can interact with other peers 
    and resources directly, even when some of the peers and resources are behind 
    firewalls and network address translations (NATs) or on different network 
    transports. 
  <p>This project belongs to the JXTA Community, and supplements services and 
    tools offered at our primary site jxta.org. Check out our many downloads, 
    documentation sets, papers and, or course, projects available at <a href="http://www.jxta.org">jxta.org</a>!
