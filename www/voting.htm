<h2>JXTA Technology Community Election Process<br>
  Version: 4 April 2008</h2>

<p>The JXTA Community actively participates in all aspects around the development 
  of JXTA technology. Although our Community is largely self-governing, our Board 
  of Directors serves to provide high-level guidence as needed. More information 
  about the Board of Governors can be found at <a href="https://jxta.dev.java.net/boardrules.htm">https://jxta.dev.java.net/boardrules.htm</a>. 
</p>
<p>This document provides information on the election process by which the JXTA 
  Community chooses new members for the Board. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Eligibility.</span>&nbsp; 
  All JXTA Technology community members in good standing may vote and are also 
  eligible to run for a Community Board Member position. A community member must 
  have a jxta.org user id and have commit access on at least one project. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Nominations.</span>&nbsp; 
  Nominations may be made by any Community Member by posting to discuss@jxta.dev.java.net. 
  Self-nominations are acceptable. All nominations must be seconded by a different 
  Community Member before a candidate is certified for an election. &nbsp;</p>
  
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big> 
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Election Certification.</span>&nbsp; 
  Elections of community board members are certified by the JXTA Technology community 
  manager or other Board appointed JXTA community member charged with conducting 
  the election. No board members may be appointed any responsibilities for conducting 
  any JXTA election while he or she is serving on the JXTA board. The vote will 
  be considered valid if votes are received from at least 50 voters. The final 
  results will be made public, but actual votes cast will be private. In the event 
  of a tie between any of the candidates that affects the election outcome, another 
  election will be held to decide among those candidates.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Election Schedule.</span> 
  The voting period will be announced by the JXTA Community Manager and will run 
  from Monday 8 AM PT to the following Friday, 8 PM PT. note: Pacific Time (PT) 
  is currently GMT minus 7 hours. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Casting Votes.</span> 
  Votes will be cast via email to stephanie.kaul@sun.com. In the event that a 
  voter submits multiple emails, the latest valid submission will be counted. 
  Voters must include their full name and jxta.dev.java.net ID. Emails will be 
  considered 'received' based on the time stamp set by the jxta.dev.java.net mail 
  list manager. <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Election Results.</span> 
  The voting results will be announced on discuss@jxta.dev.java.net by the JXTA 
  Community Manager within one (1) week of the election period closing. </p>
