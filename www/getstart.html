        an open source software project. Here are some ways that you can immediately 
        get involved:</P>
      <ul>
        <li><b>File a bug report</b> - Detailed bug reports are valuable to developers. 
          Next time you come across something you think is a bug, take some time 
          to reproduce it. If you can, file a bug report by cutting and pasting 
          the relevant information from your log file, including any stack traces 
          and uncaught exceptions. You can file bug reports <A href="bugs.html">using 
          Issuezilla</A>, the JXTA bug-tracking system. <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Join a mailing list</b> - Join the mailing lists to post general 
          feedback, feature requests, and requests for help. Also, if you see 
          a question on the list that you can answer, get to it! See the <A href="maillist.html">mailing 
          lists page</A> for details on how to subscribe.<br>
          </li>
          </li>
        <li><b>Contribute code</b> - In accordance with the JXTA <a href="http://platform.jxta.orggovern.html">governance</a> 
          process, you can submit code to the project leader as a contribution 
          either as a user, a developer, or as a committer. If your code is accepted 
          to be integrated into the source tree, then you will be asked to sign 
          a <a href="jxta_contrib_agreement.PDF">Contributor's Agreement</a> similar 
          to what Apache Software Foundation requires.<br>
