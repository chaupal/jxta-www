Thanks for your role request to jxta@java.net!   

Since this project is a place for you to start learning
about our community, we invite you to join as an "observer". 
Other roles such are "developer" are not necessary, since
we are not doing any real code development here, only sharing
of information, communication and learning. If you feel that
you need additional roles, please send an email to
Daniel Brookshier at turbogeek@dev.java.net. 

Thank You!
