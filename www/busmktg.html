<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
  'JXTA' is the name of a collaborative project, not a product or service.
  Therefore, we recommend that it is used by project participants in a  manner
 consistent with this purpose. 'JXTA' should not be used in the  name of
any  products or service implementing technologies developed as  part of
Project  JXTA. <br>
   <br>
  Sun Microsystems would not object to use of the words 'JXTA' or 'Project
  JXTA' to describe other collaborative activity taking place within the
 Project JXTA. While JXTA should not be used as the name of a product or
 service, Sun would not object to the use of the phrase 'Project JXTA' in 
 product descriptions. <br>
   <br>
  As in any instance where you use a product or service name, we suggest
 you consult your own attorney and have the name searched for potential 
conflicts  with other companies. <br>
   <br>
  SUN DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY BE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY LAW  REGARDING
 THE NAME 'JXTA', INCLUDING WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF  THIRD PARTY
 RIGHTS AND ANY OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY BE IMPLIED BY  APPLICABLE LAW.
SUN  DOES NOT GRANT ANY INDEMNITY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OR  OTHER CLAIMS ARISING
 FROM YOUR USE OF THE 'JXTA' NAME. <br>
