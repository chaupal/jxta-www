<h1>JXTA(TM) Technology - Board of Directors Rules of Order<br>
  Version: 4 April 2008</h1>
<p><br>
  <strong>Composition</strong></p>
<p>The JXTAtm Technology board of directors consists of three (3) standing members. 
  One (1) seat is reserved for a Sun Microsystems employee appointed by Sun management. 
  The other two seats are filled by community members voted in by the community 
  and certified by the JXTAtm Technology community manager or other appointed 
  JXTAtm Technology community member charged with conducting the election. No 
  board members may be appointed any responsibilities for conducting any JXTAtm 
  Technology election while he or she is serving on the JXTAtm Technology board.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>JXTAtm Technology Board Mission</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the JXTAtm Technology Board of Directors is to:</p>
<p> * ensure the successful growth of the JXTAtm Technology community<br>
  * promote the JXTA Protocols as a standard for peer to peer network application 
  development<br>
  * support JXTAtm Technology projects used to host development and distribution 
  of:<br>
  o the platform-independent JXTA protocol specifications<br>
  o JXTA-related documentation<br>
  o JXTA protocol implementations<br>
  o JXTA-aware applications</p>
<p>Limits of Board's Authority. For as long as JXTAtm Technology is not a free-standing, 
  independent legal entity, the JXTAtm Technology board does not have authority 
  to make decisions on items that have financial or legal impact to Sun Microsystems 
  without explicit, written approval by Sun Microsystems. The Sun appointed board 
  member will be entrusted to ensure appropriate company officials provide the 
  written authorization. The board may make any recommendations regarding the 
  direction and operation of JXTAtm Technology to Sun Microsystems via the Sun 
  appointed board member. The board may not vote out of office the Sun appointed 
  board member.</p>
<p><strong>JXTAtm Technology Elected Board Member Term</strong></p>
<p>Annual Election. A JXTAtm Technology elected board member's term is 2 years 
  for a member elected during a normal election as defined by the jxta.org board 
  election rules published on jxta.org. The normal term period for a board member 
  begins the first of March and ends on the last day of February. The board recommends 
  that elections be conducted during mid-January through mid-February such that 
  the election results can be certified and the new board members announced to 
  the community by 15 February. Information on JXTA Community voting procedures 
  can be found at http://www.jxta.org/community/board/voting.html.</p>
<p>Removing a Board Member. Any board member not appointed by Sun Microsystems 
  may be removed from office if his or her conduct is deemed by a majority of 
  board members to not be in the best interest of the JXTAtm Technology community. 
  This includes, for example, members that request to be removed, fail to respond 
  to meeting invitations within the appointed period, are repeatedly disruptive 
  to JXTAtm Technology community and board activities, or engage in activities 
  that present a conflict of interest. A board member is removed if a majority 
  of board members at two consecutive board meetings vote to remove him or her. 
  The board may not vote out of office the Sun appointed board member. However, 
  the Board may petition the appropriate Sun Program Manager for Project JXTA 
  to replace the appointed board member.</p>
<p>Special Election. A special election to complete an existing term is called 
  after the removal or other termination of an elected board member. A board member 
  elected during a special election is elected for the duration of the term of 
  the board member being replaced. Any board member in good standing may be re-nominated 
  for re-election except for a person removed during his or her term. Such ex-board 
  members are permanently prohibited from running or being elected to any future 
  JXTAtm Technology board seat.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>JXTAtm Technology Sun-Appointed Board Member Term</strong></p>
<p>A JXTAtm Technology Sun-appointed board member's term is 12 months by default 
  and it is recommended, but not required, that the period served corresponds 
  to the elected members' term period. The Sun-appointed board member may be changed 
  at any time and the existing member should take responsibility to ensure a smooth 
  transition. In the event the Sun-appointed board member abdicates his or her 
  responsibilities without identifying his or her replacement, the elected board 
  members will contact the appropriate Sun Microsystems official sponsoring JXTAtm 
  Technology to request a new appointment as a first order of business.</p>
<p><strong>JXTAtm Technology Board Meetings</strong></p>
<p>Definition. A JXTAtm Technology Board Meeting is an official gathering by two 
  or more board members (a quorum) where JXTAtm Technology business is conducted. 
  A board members may attend a board meeting in person, by phone, by video conference, 
  or other means that enable the member to participate in real-time with all other 
  attendees. Instant Messaging and email are not acceptable means of attendance 
  in a board meeting.</p>
<p>Frequency of Meetings. Board meetings should be held once per quarter or more 
  frequently as issues warrant. Board meetings may be called by any member of 
  the Board. Board meetings may also be requested by the JXTAtm Technology Community 
  Manager, the JXTAtm Technology Program Manager, or any JXTAtm Technology Community 
  Member. However, only meetings called by a current board member are mandatory.</p>
<p>Scheduling of Meetings. A Board meeting must be scheduled within ten (10) business 
  days of the date of request by a board member. The JXTAtm Technology Community 
  Manager may be asked to assist in scheduling an optimal meeting time.</p>
<p>Meeting Notifications. All board members must be invited to participate in 
  any board meeting at least three (3) business days prior to the meeting. Meeting 
  invitations are deemed to be valid if reasonable efforts were made to reach 
  board members such as by email with no error returned, phone call and message 
  to the last known good number for the board member, written Post mail sent to 
  the last known valid street or post office address for the member with no return 
  message, or other generally accepted invitation mechanism. A board member may 
  decline to participate in a board meeting and give consent for others to meet 
  without him or her in which case the meeting will proceed as planned. Should 
  a board member not acknowledge the invitation within ten (10) business days 
  of a reasonable invitation, the board member requesting the meeting may proceed 
  with the meeting at the soonest date convenient for all responding members who 
  intended to attend.</p>
<p>Meeting Types, Participants, and their Roles. Meetings may be open or closed 
  at the discretion of board members calling the meeting. Closed meetings are 
  limited to only board member participation. Open meetings may include, in addition 
  to board members, one or more of JXTAtm Technology community manager, JXTAtm 
  Technology program manager, or JXTAtm Technology community member. The degree 
  to which a meeting is open is at the discretion of the board members. When board 
  members do not have consensus on the appropriate attendance for a meeting, the 
  meeting becomes a closed meeting. Open meetings should be scheduled with reasonable 
  lead time, at the discretion of the board, to encourage appropriate attendance. 
</p>
<p>Maximizing transparency of board activities is strongly encouraged. It is recommended, 
  but not required, that an external observer, for example, jxta.org community 
  manager, participate in all board meetings. Each meeting should have an assigned 
  meeting leader selected from attending board members and a note taker selected 
  from any meeting participant. Non board members attending the meeting may be 
  asked to comment or contribute to the meeting.</p>
<p>Item Resolution (Board Voting). Only board members attending a meeting can 
  vote on items raised during the board meeting. A simple majority is required 
  for any items for which there is no consensus. In the event that there is a 
  tie in the voting on an item, the issue will be deferred to the next board meeting 
  to allow any non-attending board members to vote on the item. A board member's 
  vote on an item is carried into the next board meeting even if the board member 
  does not attend the next meeting. A board member must attend the next meeting 
  in order to reverse his or her prior vote on record for an item that remained 
  in a tie. Should the item remain in a tie after two consecutive board meetings, 
  the Sun appointed board member will be given an additional vote used to break 
  the tie.</p>
<p>Meeting Conduct and Structure. Meetings should generally follow the standing 
  agenda items:</p>
<p> 1. Designation of meeting leader selected from participating board members. 
  Leader guides meeting through the agenda items that follow<br>
  2. Call to order and roll call<br>
  3. Assignment of meeting note taker for current meeting selected from any meeting 
  participant (not necessarily a board member)<br>
  4. Review of previous meeting minutes and approval with our without modification<br>
  5. Status of existing open items from prior meetings.<br>
  6. Identification of new topics and agreement of which ones to cover<br>
  7. Discussion of selected new topics<br>
  8. Identification and assignment of new action items<br>
  9. Scheduling of next meeting<br>
  10. Move to adjourn</p>
<p><br>
  Meeting Notes Publication. Meeting minutes are not be published until after 
  ratification at a subsequent Board Meeting. Meeting notes are to be sent by 
  the appointed note taker for review by all board members within two (2) weeks 
  of the board meeting. While maximum transparency of board activities is encouraged 
  (and hence publishing all meeting notes on the JXTAtm Technology community pages 
  is recommended), any attending board member may identify any items not to be 
  published due to their sensitive or personal nature. Such items are not to be 
  published unless overturned by majority vote during the subsequent board meeting.</p>
