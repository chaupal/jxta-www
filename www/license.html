    <h3>Respect For Copyright Ownership and Law</h3>

    <p>On-line resource-sharing technologies have created opportunities to directly and 
    more easily communicate data to others. Although Sun cannot universally prevent, control, 
    monitor or record the sharing activities of peers and groups created by others using the 
    JXTA technology, Sun strongly adheres to an overriding principle requiring the highest 
    level of respect for the rights and property of copyright owners, including Sun, as 
    paramount to the passion to collaborate and develop new technologies. All users and 
    participants in this JXTA project are reminded to comply with applicable law and 
    regulation, the JXTA license, Terms of Use, and these Guiding Principles concerning 
    any use of copyrighted materials. In this regard, Sun maintains that development which 
    makes it easier to create new products and services can be provided without infringing 
    the intellectual property rights of others. </p>
