New Project Owner Guidelines<br>
Last modified 26 February 2003
<p>Welcome to Project JXTA as owner of a new project! As a new project owner, 
  there are a few things to bring to your attention:</p>
<p> 1. Make sure you are authorized to contribute technology to the project. If 
  you have not already sent in a completed Contributor Agreement, please take 
  a moment to fill one out and fax or mail it as instructed. Please be sure to 
  read the License page, and understand the terms under which code is contributed 
  to jxta.org.</p>
<p><br>
  2. Make sure all developers that contribute code either as a committer or project 
  owner (which you approved), or as a patch which you or your other committers 
  or owners accepted, have a completed Contributor Agreement on file. It is the 
  same form mentioned above. This ensures that contributors have the right to 
  provide the technology and will do so under the Apache-style license used by 
  the rest of the code on the public site. If you are not sure if someone on your 
  project has a contributor agreement on file with the jxta.org community office, 
  please ask the jxta.org community manager to look it up.</p>
<p><br>
  3. As project owner, you should help enforce the jxta.org license provisions 
  by ensuring that all source files in your project include the appropriate license 
  text.</p>
<p> 4. Use the main discuss@jxta.org and dev@jxta.org aliases for your project 
  communications. Encourage your other project members to primarily use those 
  as well. Your project has cvs and issues mailing lists as these are used by 
  system generated messages. The current convention on jxta.org is to use the 
  primary lists as opposed to project-specific discussion lists so other community 
  members can remain aware of what's going on. If your project generates a lot 
  of email traffic, you may create your own project mailing lists. For more info, 
  see the mailing lists page.</p>
<p> 5. Send a note to the main discuss@jxta.org alias announcing and describing 
  your new project and inviting participants to contribute! When you have a new 
  release or other progress to report, you should also post a note to the discuss 
  list and let the community know about your progress.</p>
<p> 6. Regularly review requests for new project roles on your project (at least 
  twice a week). I recommend you approve all request for contributor status as 
  this adds the ability to submit issues. I recommend you and the other members 
  of your project review carefully whom you approve as a committer (make sure 
  they have a Contributor Agreement on file) and more so whom you approve as a 
  project owner. Committer adds the ability to check code directly into CVS for 
  your project. Owner adds above that the ability to grant roles to other jxta.org 
  users on the project and to modify the information displayed on the project 
  pages. (See the Governance Page for more information about member roles on Project 
  JXTA.)</p>
<p> 7. Make sure your project has a good description on the project's home page. 
  (Not all projects currently have good descriptions.) Read the jxta.org style 
  guide for some notes on home page construction. Check out the JnuShare, myJXTA2, 
  or Edutella projects for good examples.</p>
<p> 8. Make sure your project remains active and keep your project home page up 
  to date. Projects that have no activity on CVS, its project pages, or on mailing 
  lists for over 30 days will be considered stale and are subject to removal from 
  the jxta.org site.</p>
<p> 9. Remain abreast of the overall status of Project JXTA and be prepared to 
  provide your inputs to community issues. As a project owner on jxta.org, your 
  informed opinions and votes on the overall direction and decisions on Project 
  JXTA are important as they carry more weight than non-project owner community 
  members.<br>
