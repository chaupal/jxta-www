<h2>Roles and Responsibilities </h2>
<h3>Users </h3>
<p>Users are the people who use the products of the Project. People in this role aren't
contributing code, but they are using the products, reporting bugs, making feature
requests, and such. This is by far the most important category of people as, without users,
there is no reason for the Project. 

<p>When a user starts to contribute code or documentation patches, they become a
developer. 

<h3>Developers </h3>
<p>Developers are the people who write code or documentation patches or contribute 
  positively to the project in other ways. A developer's contribution is always 
  recognized. In source code, all developers who contribute to a source file may 
  add their name to the list of authors for that file. 
<p><br>
<p>
<h3>Commiters</h3>
<p>Developers who give frequent and valuable contributions to a subproject of the Project
can have their status promoted to that of a "Committer" for that subproject. A Committer
has write access to the source code repository and gains voting rights allowing them to
affect the future of the subproject. 

<p>In order for a Developer to become a Committer, another Committer can nominate that
Developer or the Developer can ask for it. Once a Developer is nominated, all of the
Committers for a subproject will vote. If there are at least 3 positive votes and no
negative votes, the Developer is converted into a Committer and given write access to
the source code repository for that subproject. 

<p>Once there are 3 positive votes, someone from the project community who already has
commit access should send email to: jxta.org that the account
should be created. The following information must be included in the email: 

<ul>
<li>The name and email address of the new user. (eg: John Smith <john.smith@FOO.COM>) 
<li>Suggested account userid. This is optional. (eg: jmsith) 
<li>The project that the user should be given access to. (eg: Jakarta Foo) 
<li>The results of the votes. In other words, the names and email addresses of the committers who approved the addition. </li>
</ul>

<p>Note 0: If a committer already has an account on the jxta.org server and the 
committer needs commit access to additional projects, then all that needs to be done is to 
have the user notify pmc@jxta.org with the results of the voting (as 
documented above) and the user will be given access. In other words, the root email 
address should only be used on the basis of new account creation. </p>

<p>Note 1: All committers will be given access to the jjxta-site module on request. In
other words, committers should be able to update the main Project JXTA website. </p>

<p>Note 2: If the module that the committer needs access to is a sub module within a 
project, it is up to the individual project to determine how to deal with giving out access. 
In other words, access may be granted by default to all sub modules or it can be granted by vote. </p>
 
<p>At times, Committers may go inactive for a variety of reasons. A Committer that has
been inactive for 6 months or more may lose their status as a Committer. Getting access
back is as simple as re-requesting it on the projects developer mailing list.

  Credits</A>.</p>

<h3>Project Management Committee (PMC)</h3>
<p>Committers who frequently participate with valuable contributions may have their status
promoted to that of a "Project Management Committee Member". This committee is the
official managing body of the Project JXTA and is responsible for setting overall project
direction. In order to become a Member, someone on the PMC must nominate the
Committer. The individual may then be approved with a 3/4 majority of the PMC.
