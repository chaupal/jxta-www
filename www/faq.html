<br><a NAME="whatisjxta"></a><b>Q: What is JXTA?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> JXTA is a research project incubated at Sun Microsystems
under the guidance of Bill Joy and Mike Clary.Its goal is to explore a
vision of distributed computing using peer-to-peer topology, and to develop
basic building blocks and services that would enable innovative applications
for peer groups. Recognizing this effort would benefit from expert coders
outside of Sun (Joy’s Law: Some of the best people work elsewhere”), the
project has posted a draft of a specification and some prototype code to
a website, <a href="http://www.jxta.org/">www.jxta.org</a> under the Apache
Software License, encouraging others to join in our efforts. The project
now is evolving daily.&nbsp;</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="standfor"></a><b>Q: What does JXTA stand for?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> JXTA is short for Juxtapose, as in side by side. It
is a recognition that peer to peer is juxtapose to client server or Web
based computing -- what is considered today’s traditional computing model.&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="prototype"></a><b>Q: What is prototype code?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> JXTA is short for Juxtapose, as in side by side. Prototype
is a term we have used to represent code that has been developed as proof-of-concept,
to demonstrate an implementation of our ideas and specifications. It is
considered usable code, with a caution that it has not been through rigorous
quality assurance processes. Developers are working with it currently to
understand our approach and design, and to prototype their own applications.&nbsp;</td>

<br><a NAME="whouses"></a><b>Q: Who uses JXTA?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> JXTA is short for Juxtapose, as in side by side.Today,
JXTA is still mostly a research project. Developers who are interested
in developing peer-to-peer applications and various individual hackers
are using it to create their own prototypes. As JXTA matures, applications
written based on the current design and specifications can potentially
be used by a variety of users on anything from severs to PCs to pagers.&nbsp;</td>

<p><b>A:</b> We encourage contributions to JXTA. At first, we recommend
you join the general mailing lists, discuss@jxta.org and participate in

module, and either commented on or, more likely, implemented.
<p>&nbsp;The formal "governance" process outlining a procedure for how
developers get even more involved and become what many Open Source projects
call a "Committer" where you have write access to the Content Versioning
System (CVS), or even a Project Owner has not been established yet. We
expect the community to propose this, and to vote on a governance system
by early fall. For more information about this, see our <a href="govern.html">governance</a>

<br><a NAME="jxtadiff"></a><b>Q: How is JXTA different than other
P2P technologies?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> There are several P2P technologies proposed and/or in use
today, both at the application level and at the platform level. As outlined
on <a href="http://www.jxta.org/">http://www.jxta.org</a> in our <a href="white_papers.html">white
papers</a> and <a href="jxta.pdf">draft specifications</a>,
JXTA is a modular platform that provides simple and essential building
blocks for developing a wide range of peer-to-peer services and applications.
JXTA specifies a set of protocols rather than an API. Thus, JXTA can be
implemented in any language on any Operating System. We anticipate solutions
will range from providing a simple protocol-based wrapper that enables
a small device to join a network of peers to developing a fully integrated
application that supports metering, monitoring, high-level security and
communication not just within a group, but also across groups on server-class
systems.
<p>The JXTA platform provides a de-centralized environment that minimizes
single-points of failure and is not dependent on any centralized services.
Both centralized and de-centralized services can be developed on top of
the JXTA platform. JXTA services can be implemented to interoperate with
other services giving rise to new distributed network computing applications. 
For example, a P2P
communications service like instant messaging can easily be added to a
resource sharing P2P application if both support the JXTA protocols.&nbsp;</td>

<br><a NAME="sunone"></a><b>Q: How does JXTA fit in with Sun[tm]
Open Net Environment Webtop (Sun ONE Webtop)?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Sun One Webtop is an open network environment whose architecture
is designed to help create access, and deploy Web services on the network.
This is significant to P2P because any peer on the network should have
access to these Web services. JXTA enables Web services to also
be distributed in a P2P environment.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="busmodel"></a><b>Q: What is Sun’s business model for JXTA?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Sun's main focus is to develop innovative systems and software
that support pervasive networking. JXTA provides added value by
enabling our systems and software to become active peers in a peer-to-peer
network as a complement to Sun's current client/server network solutions.&nbsp;</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="jini"></a><b>Q: How does JXTA compare to Jini[tm]
technology?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Jini[tm] technology is a mechanism for connecting distributed
services within a Java[tm] network using an object model and a centralized
service location broker. JXTA is a mechanism for connecting distributed
services in a peer-style network, using a loosely-coupled data model (XML).
We anticipate both solutions to be used, depending on the requirements
of an application. We believe Jini[tm] technology developers can implement
some very powerful services to interact with JXTA distributed network
computing services and applications.
<p>Jini[tm] and JXTA show how you can get different answers to
similar problems if you start from different assumptions. Jini[tm] addresses
distributed computing by beginning with the assumption that Java[tm] bytecodes
can be interpreted anywhere. From that base, Jini[tm] built a way of organizing
networks of services and users of those services around the idea of mobile
Java[tm] objects, where services advertise themselves and find other services
by using the Java[tm] type system. The result is a system that is protocol
independent but is tied to the Java[tm] platform, requiring at least one
machine on the network to be able to run a full Java[tm] environment.
<p>JXTA defines a set of protocols, expressed in XML, for distributed
network computing. JXTA allows network entities to find other network
entities, which once found can join into collaborations in application-specified
ways. JXTA does not require that there be any particular platform
that is supported by any of the participants of the network, but does specify
the form and content of the messages that will be exchanged for network
participants to find each other.&nbsp;
<p><b>Q: Can Jini[tm] and JXTA be used together?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. The JXTA protocols could easily be used to find
a Jini[tm] lookup service, or (more likely) to find a Jini[tm] surrogate
host. Once such a surrogate host was found, the Jxta participant could
load a Java object that could act as a gateway between the JXTA
and Jini[tm] worlds. The details for such an approach can be found in the
Jini[tm] community project for the surrogate architecture.&nbsp;
<p><b>Q: What is the difference between the JXTA community and
the Jini[tm] community?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> The Jini[tm] community, which has been in existence since
January of 2000, is a group of developers who are doing research and development
in Jini[tm] technology and products that use Jini[tm]. The Jini[tm] community
requires the acceptance of the Jini[tm] Community Source License, and requires
that anyone producing clients or services that are Jini[tm] compatible
test those clients or services with the freely available Jini[tm] Technical
Compatibility Kit. The JXTA community technology uses a slighly
modified version of the Apache Open Source license, and is built around
a community of researchers who are united in extending the JXTA
architecture. There are no formal requirements for compatibility but compatibility
ensures the largest degree of interoperability with other JXTA
applications and services.&nbsp;
<p><b>Q: Why are there seemingly two approaches to the same problem coming
from Sun?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Different requirements result in different systems. The Jini[tm]
technology requires the existence, within a network, of at least one computer
capable of running a Java environment. While this is common, it is not
universal. In those cases where size or existing code require a language-neutral
approach, JXTA can provide some of the basic Jini[tm] functions.&nbsp;</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="uddi"></a><b>Q: How does JXTA compare with UDDI?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> UDDI is a centralized business registry that enables business-to-business
communication. Members who register as a UDDI client become privy to a
system to search and share business opportunities. It is based on XML,
and for its members, provides a similar service to JXTA.&nbsp;
<p>JXTA provides a system for applications and services to announce themselves
as JXTA-friendly, and create, join and monitor peer groups in a more distributed
fashion. There is no sign-up process or fee; it is a more loosely organized
system and will likely attract a more diverse collection of users, hackers,
and businesses.
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; This should ultimately be expanded to include a discussion
about advertisements and discovery in JXTA.&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="soap"></a><b>Q: How does JXTA compare with Simple
Object Access Protocol (SOAP) sponsored by the W3C?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), is designed to enable
accessing remote services with other SOAP applications. Like SOAP, JXTA
uses XML message exchange. In addition, JXTA provides protocol
specifications to enable remote service access. However, JXTA provides
additional protocols and services to implement a full P2P application.
These include Peer Discovery to enable peers for find each other, Peer
Groups to allow organization of Peers and control membership, Peer Pipes
to support flexible and secure communications among peers, and Peer Monitors
to allow additional management of peers in a network. It is conceivable
to send SOAP compliant messages through JXTA pipes to other JXTA peers.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="net"></a><b>Q: How does JXTA compare with Microsoft’s
.NET?&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>A:</b> .NET borrows extensively from the concepts pioneered and led
by SUN's Java[tm] Programming language. It consists of a common run-time
execution environment and a set of requirements imposed on developer tools
with the goal of enabling interoperability across the proliferation of
Microsoft development languages and environments such as Visual Basic,
ASP, Visual C++, and now C#. JXTA is not a programming language; 
it defines a set of protocols that support interoperability among Peers 
in a distributed network computing environment.

JXTA applications can be developed in any language and can interoperate
with other JXTA applications regardless of their implementation language
and underlying operating system.&nbsp;</td>

<br><a NAME="comp"></a><b>Q: What are the main components of JXTA?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> JXTA is most often described using three layers; a
core layer, a middle "services" layer, and an application layer. The core
layer includes the minimum protocols and building blocks to enable key
mechanisms for peer to peer networking, including discovery, transport
(including firewall management and limited security), and the creation
of peers and peer groups. The services layer provides hooks for supporting
generic services (such as searching, sharing and added security) that are
used in many P2P and distributed network computing services and applications. 
And finally, the application layer supports
implementation of integrated applications, such as music sharing, resource
sharing, monetary systems, distributed storage, and other creative applications
yet to be realized. These applications can be "vertical" or they can be
developed to interoperate with other distributed network computing 
applications developed to the
JXTA core. The entire system is designed to be modular, and to allow developers
to pick and choose a collection of these services and applications that
suits their needs. For more information on these components, review our
<a href="white_papers.html">white paper</a> (high level overview)

<br><a NAME="peer"></a><b>Q: Who can be a Peer?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Peers are any devices that run some or all the JXTA
protocols. A peer can be anything with a digital heartbeat that supports
the JXTA core, including servers, PCs, PDAs, manufacturing and test equipment,
and cellular phones. In order to participate into JXTA, the peer needs
to be connected to some kind of network, such as IP, Bluetooth, or Havi.&nbsp;</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="pipes"></a><b>Q: What are JXTA "pipes?"</b>
<p><b>A:</b> In JXTA, pipes provide the primary channels for communication.
They are a mechanism for establishing uni-directional, asynchronous communication
between peers. The pipe endpoints are non-localized to a physical peer,
but are dynamically bound at creation time enabling developers to build
highly available services where pipe connections can be established independently
of a peer location. Pipes in JXTA are indiscriminate; they will support
binary code, data strings, Java technology-based objects, and/or applets.
Asynchronous pipes enable to build large-scale inter-connected services
and applications.
<p>JXTA also uses the verb "pipe" to describe concatenating commands within
the JXTA shell. This is akin to the UNIX&reg; term "piping" where standard output
| standard input, etc. See <a href="faq.html#discussion">discussion
of JXTA Shell</a>.&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="shell"></a><b>Q: What is the JXTA Shell?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> The JXTA Shell is an application that enables users
to interact with the JXTA platform through a command-line interpreter.
Much like the UNIX&reg; shell, it is useful for accessing and managing
core platform objects (peers, groups, pipes), debugging communications
problems, checking the status of peers and/or peer groups, and communicating
with "external" JXTA services and applications. As in UNIX&reg;, the JXTA
shell allows users to "pipe" shell commands together -- connecting commands
"on-the-fly." Pipes in JXTA are useful for collecting information at one
site and perhaps processing the command at another. For example, a user
may query a local peer group for original music, pipe the results of query
to another peer that provides a music rating service, and pipe that result
to another peer providing a sorting service, next filtering the result
locally to identify music of a certain genre of interest, and finally sending
the result to a peer that returns concert listings for the selected music.
<p>The JXTA Shell is not part of the JXTA core. It is an optional application
designed for users and/or developers who are interested in a way to interact
with the platform, monitor certain activities of their peer applications,
and feed the results for another purpose. Shell commands are dynamically
loaded and started by the JXTA Shell framework when they are invoked. This
allows the JXTA Shell to be easily extended with new commands without having
to change the source code in the shell framework and existing commands.
As with the UNIX&reg; shell, we anticipate multiple versions of a Shell
application will be developed to reflect unique application requirements.

documentation?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> "Codat" is a term we created to represent any computer content
-- code, data, applications, or other collection of computer representable
resources. JXTA does not distinguish among different types of resources
that can be stored on a computer and shared among peers in a peer group.

<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="firewalls"></a><b>Q: How does JXTA work with firewalls?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> In order for JXTA peers to communicate with each other
across a firewall, at least one peer in the peer group inside the firewall
must be aware of at least one peer outside of the firewall. Furthermore,
the peer inside and the peer outside the firewall that are aware of each
other, must support HTTP transport, and, the firewall has to allow HTTP
data transfers. These HTTP transfers need not be restricted to port 80
though that is the port used by default by most Web browsers and by the
current JXTA implementation. The two peers described become routers for
P2P traffic among the other peers in the peer group. There can be more
than multiple peers routing P2P JXTA messages across the firewall.
<p>Currently, the settings necessary to support firewalls and HTTP transport
are made via configuration files for the JXTA Shell. We anticipate more
advanced treatments of firewalls will be developed as part of basic services
and higher-level applications.&nbsp;</td>

other peers. Contacted peers contain variable sized caches that map nearby
peers' unique ID to their current address.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="security"></a><b>Q: What kind of security does JXTA
use?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> JXTA has as its goal the implementation of a model
that considers what we have code-named a "P2P Web of Trust", which is in
the spirit of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) "Web of Trust" for secure electronic
mail. Just like in PGP, the "Web of Trust" is used to exchange public keys
among its members. Each peer group policy may permit some members to be
trusted to the extent that they have the authority to sign public keys
for other members as well as to do things like authenticate, add new members,
and remove or revoke membership.&nbsp;
<p>JXTA will initially implement security classes for the RSA public key
exchange, the RC4 byte stream cipher, and the SHA-1 hash algorithm. These
will enable privacy by the means of a P2P TLS implementation; integrity
with signed hashes; non-repudiation using the "Web of Trust;" and MACs
for data authenticity. Combinations of these classes form security suites,
and JXTA provides the mechanism to add new customized suites as required.&nbsp;
<p>For peer group authentication a separate Pluggable Authentication Module
(PAM) will be present. JXTA will have anonymous or guest login, and login
with user name and password. A login session may be in clear or cipher-text
as per the peer group security policy.
<p>Since the JXTA security module is available to the core, services and
applications, advanced services and applications can "plug in" their own
security components and protocols. For example, the "Web of Trust" could
be defined by a policy that requires authorized peer group members to be
well known certificate authorities, and that peers exchange X509v3 CA signed
certificates.&nbsp;</td>

<br><a NAME="active"></a><b>Q: Can a JXTA peer be active in more
than one JXTA peer group?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. Joining a new peer group does not imply leaving another.
However, the shell currently supports only one environment at a time. If
you are using the JXTA Shell to interact with a JXTA peer group X (vs.
an application that can do whatever it implements and can manage multiple
groups simultaneously), and you join a new peer group Y, the shell creates
a new set of environment variables for Y. The "chpgrp" command is used
to change which peer group variables are active for the shell. The old
services are not stopped while the shell is running so codats that were
being shared still are accessible by other peers in the group. However,
this does NOT imply that codats in one peer group are automatically accessible
by peers in another group unless the codat is explicitly "shared" in both
groups.</td>

non-JXTA applications from the JXTA shell?</b>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. For content management, MIME type information included

known content types handle them automatically. However, today the shell
has no specific handlers for these things.
<p>We anticipate developers will devise "JXTA Adapters" to execute external
programs.
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; These should be implemented with appropriate security
safeguards to avoid the problems common with Microsoft office applications.
<p>An adapter could essentially map data and connect applications for remote
launches. Some examples might be:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li type="1">
UNIX&reg; stdio to JXTA stdio adapter - this would enable piping of JXTA commands
to UNIX&reg; commands on UNIX&reg; platforms. This would open up a lot of possibilities
on UNIX&reg; platforms because piping is so prevalent in UNIX&reg;</li>

<li type="1">
JXTA stream to xyz player adapter - these would be platform and application
specific, but they would handle any necessary real-time data conversion
between a JXTA pipe and the format required by the player. These need not
be unidirectional. For example, you could adapt the output of a video capture
application to become a JXTA stream.</li>

<li type="1">
HTML to JXTA studio - could be used to post and get information to/from
Web pages to allow JXTA peers to interact with existing Web sites. For
example, can launch a search for titles and prices on Amazon and pipe the

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP class="PlainText">
<br><a NAME="applet"></a><b>Q: Can the JXTA Shell be run as an

the network connections that can be made by an applet and the JXTA
core would not be able to run inside the Applet Viewer. The Applet Viewer
also prevents access to the local file system making the machine running
the applet behave only as a client (aka "freeloader" in Gnutella).
<p>Someone could write a version of the shell that runs as a signed applet
to provide the functionality normally restricted by the default security
of the Java Applet Viewer. A potential application for this is remote control
