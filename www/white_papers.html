 This document gives an overview of the JXTA technology. It includes information
on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing, the history of Project JXTA, the benefits
of &nbsp;JXTA technology, and examples of what companies are doing with JXTA
technology today.<br>

An Open, Innovative Collaboration</a></b> <br>
 Interest in peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is growing rapidly, as evidenced
by the popularity of services like Napster, Gnutella, and SETI@home. Seeing
the potential of P2P computing to enable access to a broader, deeper Web,
Sun started a small research effort called Project JXTA. This paper examines
the evolution of Internet use, the expanded access that the technology promises,
and Sun's efforts to advance network computing through Project JXTA. Sun's
efforts in offering JXTA technology through the open source model is described.

JXTA: A Technology Overview</a></b> <br>
 Project JXTA is an effort to develop a network programming and computing
platform to solve a number of problems in modern distributed computing. This
paper explains the basic elements of JXTA technology, including terminology,
protocols and considerations for security. The Project JXTA release 1.0 implementation
from Sun Microsystems, Inc. is described, as is the JXTA Shell applications
and prospects for future development.<br>

for J2ME<sup>TM</sup> - Extending the Reach of Wireless With JXTA Technology</b></a>:
    <br>
 Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing readily lends itself to the more dynamic environments
of wireless devices. Characterized by their ability to create, join, and
interact with peer groups, and to post advertisements to offer and solicit
resources, P2P applications can dynamically find what they need - an approach
more suited to the wireless lifestyle. Project JXTA for J2ME is the response
of the JXTA developer community to this need. Designed to offer a rich programming
environment for creating applications using the P2P computing model, JXTA
for J2ME technology promises to accelerate development for those wishing
to participate in the wireless applications marketplace. <br>

Peer-to-Peer Distributed Computing in a Heterogeneous, Decentralized Environment</a></b>
    <br>
 This paper presents a framework for large-scale computations for problems
that feature coarse-grained parallelization. The components of this framework
are based on Java, which allows for a wide variety of platforms and components,
and peer-to-peer communication is provided through the JXTA protocols, which
allow for a dynamic and decentralized organization of computational resources.<br>

v. 5, pp. 88-95, 2001 <br>
 JXTA technology provides a network programming and computing platform designed
to solve a number of problems in modern distributed computing, especially
in the burgeoning realm of peer-to-peer (p2p) computing. The objective of
Project JXTA include interoperability among otherwise competing p2p applications,
platform and programming language independence, and ubiquity of deployment.
At its core, JXTA is a protocol suite focusing on mechanisms instead of policy,
so that application developers have maximum freedom to innovate and offer 
competitive solutions.<br>

 This paper presents an up-to-date overview of the JXTA protocols and describes
the latest implementation of the JXTA protocols in the "C" programming language.
Included are discussions of the overall architecture and trade-offs made
to allow the JXTA-C implementation to run on a wide range of devices including
supercomputers, servers, PCs and memory-constrainted embedded devices.

    The JXTA protocols are independent of any programming language, and multiple 
    implementations (called bindings in Project JXTA) exist for different environments. 
    This document specifically discusses the Project JXTA binding on the Java<sup>TM</sup> 
    2 Platform, Standard Edition software (J2SE<sup>TM</sup>).&nbsp; This document 
    is intended for software developers who would like to write and deploy P2P 
    services and applications using the Java programming language and JXTA technology.&nbsp; 
    It matches the Project JXTA J2SE 2.3.x platform binding stable release. <a

    This document describes in detail the architecture and components of Project 
    JXTA technology. The key elements and their role in supporting peer-to-peer 
    computing environments are discussed. These include peers, advertisements, 
    messages, pipes, and protocols. Specifications for the advertisements and 
    protocols defined in the 2.0 Release are described including functions, XML 
    definitions, and as appropriate, data structures.<br>

    In addition to being an application that illustrates the use of JXTA Technology, 
    the JXTA Shell is a useful tool that can help end users understand the value 
    of Peer-to-Peer computing. The JXTA Shell permits interactive access the JXTA 
    platform building blocks through a simple, text based interface. This document 
    describes the syntax and functionality of each of the JXTA shell commands, 
    and also discusses the open framework that allows developers to add additional 
    commands.<br>

    Getting Started (using the Project JXTA Shell)</a></b> <i>April 2001</i><br>
    Getting hands on JXTA technology is simple. With the release of Version 1.0, 
    users running the Solaris Operating Environment, Linux, or Microsoft Windows 
    can freely download binaries and source, along a prototype application, the 
    JXTA Shell. By experimenting with the JXTA Shell, users can quickly grasp 
    the power and potential of peer-to-peer computing. This document creates a 
    fast track for users and developers that are curious about JXTA technology 
    and want to know more.</li>

    <i>March 2003<br>
    </i>Bernard Traversat, Mohamed Abdelaziz, Eric Pouyoul: Sun Microsystems, 
    Inc.<br>
    The following paper describes a loosely-consistent DHT walker approach for 
    searching advertisements and routing queries in the JXTA rendezvous network.&nbsp; 
    The loosely-consistent DHT walker uses a hybrid approach that combines the 
    use of a DHT to index and locate contents, with a limited range walker to 
    resolve inconsistency of the DHT within the dynamic rendezvous network. This 
    proposed DHT approach does not require maintaining consistency across the 
    rendezvous network, a stable super-peer infrastructure, and is well adapted 
    to ad hoc P2P networks with high peer churn rate.&nbsp; <br>
