<h1>Governance Guidelines </h1>
<p><br>
  We believe that a governance system that is clearly outlined and fairly represents 
  the community is essential to the development of JXTA(TM) technology.</p>
<p>JXTA technology is about providing a common framework, on top of which innovative 
  distributed computing applications can be developed. This common framework will 
  need to mature and become stable-staying small, but supporting essential qualities 
  required by a majority of developers. A strong governance system will provide 
  a means to manage the process of its evolution. Initially we will build on the 
  model used by other open source projects, a meritocracy based on consensus.</p>
<p>All decision making, planning and communication will be done in the open, on 
  public mailing lists.</p>
<p>Roles and Responsibilities<br>
  Basically the structure we envision is the following:</p>
<p> * Developer<br>
  * Contributor<br>
  * Committer<br>
  * Project Owner<br>
  * Board</p>
<p>Developers<br>
  Developers are the people who use JXTA technology to create new JXTA-based services 
  and applications. Developers aren't contributing code, but they are using the 
  shell, reporting bugs, making feature requests and suggestions. This is by far 
  the most important category of people. Without developers, there is no reason 
  for the Project. When a developer starts to contribute code or documentation 
  patches, they become a contributor.</p>
<p>How to become one: Download JXTA technology, and use it to write code.</p>
<p>Contributors<br>
  Contributors are developers who contribute patches and code (by e-mail or via 
  the appropriate project related mailing lists/forums), and users of the JXTA 
  software who want to report bugs or comments. Contributors do not have CVS check-in 
  access. A developer who has sent in solid, useful patches on a project can be 
  elevated to contributor status by the project owner. Integration of developers' 
  contributions is at the discretion of the project owner, but this is an iteractive, 
  communicative process.</p>
<p>How to become one: Get the source, make an improvement or fix a bug, and send 
  that code to the developers mailing list.</p>
<p>Committers<br>
  A committer has check-in access to the development, or &quot;bleeding edge&quot; 
  branch of the source tree. Committers can directly make changes to the source 
  base of the development branch, from which the nightly builds are made.</p>
<p>How to become one: Submit a number of patches via e-mail, and ask the project 
  project owner for commit access.</p>
<p>Project Owners<br>
  Each project has at least one project owner. Each project owner has check-in 
  permissions on the stable branch of the source tree. Project owners &quot;manage&quot; 
  a group of contributors, and are responsible for merging these contributors' 
  patches, bug fixes, and new code from the development branch of the source tree 
  onto the stable branch. Project owners are responsible for making sure that 
  these contirbutions do not break the build.</p>
<p>Project owners are responsible for the Web space for that project, at the project 
  home page (accessible under CVS), and for granting check-in privileges for contributors.</p>
<p>New project owners may find useful guidelines for running your project at http://www.jxta.org/ProjectOwnerGuidelines.html.</p>
<p>How to become one:</p>
<p> * Start a project (you should have written some working code or drafts to 
  do this)<br>
  * Have the responsibility for that project handed over to you from the current 
  project owner<br>
  * Take over an abandoned project<br>
  * Initially, as Sun contributed the source base, the project owners of Projects 
  JXTA projects are the developers who either wrote the projects, or currently 
  have responsibility for them. Undoubtedly, in the future, there will be non-Sun 
  people in these roles as well.<br>
  * For ongoing projects moving here, or new projects that are hosted here, the 
  person who started that project or currently maintains it is the project owner. 
  If you start a project, you are the project owner of that project.</p>
<p>Contributor Agreement</p>
<p>Any developer who wishes to become a &quot;Contributor, Committer, and/or Project 
  Owner&quot; -- in that he/she wishes to contribute new code to the Concurrent 
  Versions System (CVS) tree -- must also sign a Contributor Agreement similar 
  to what the Apache Software Foundation requires. This agreement clarifies that 
  to your knowledge, the code you've submitted was developed by you, and that 
  you have authority to provide it and any related IP to JXTA technology.<br>
  The Board<br>
  The Board consists of three members, including one representative selected by 
  Sun and two independent, non-Sun representatives who are nominated and elected 
  by the community. The current Board was elected in February 2005 to a term of 
  one year. Notice will be given of the next election on the jxta.org homepage 
  and on the discuss@jxta.org and announce@jxta.org lists.</p>
<p>The Board has high-level duties to ensure that the jxta.org project is being 
  run in a fair and open manner. The Board exists as a last resort to resolve 
  disputes and grievances. Every effort should be made to solve disputes at the 
  community level before turning to the Board.</p>
<p>We are attempting to make the governance procedures as lightweight as possible. 
  We seek above all to invite all interested developers to take part in the enhancement 
  of this project and seek input from all. We are attempting to make sure the 
  governance procedures will not hinder the momentum of any group or individual 
  who seeks to use JXTA technology.</p>
<p>This governance system might change as the Project JXTA community grows, but 
  we are committed to a system that is fair and open to all community members. 
  If you have any questions, suggestions, and/or concerns, please post them on 
  the general mailing list, discuss@jxta.org.</p>
<p>The current elected Board members are Daniel Brookshier and Vanessa Williams, 
  who begin their term on March 1, 2006. The Sun representative is Bernard Traversat.</p>
<p> * Election results from the February 2006, Board election, are available online. 
  The JXTA community will be holding our next elections Spring 2007.<br>
  * The term for the JXTA Board of Directors was changed from 1 year to 2 years 
  per community vote February 2006.<br>
  * Board of Director meeting notes are available.</p>
