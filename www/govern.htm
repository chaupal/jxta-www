<H1>Governance Guidelines 
</H1>
<P><BR>We believe that a <A HREF="http://jxta.dev.java.net/boardrules">governance
system</A> that is clearly outlined and fairly represents the
community is essential to the development of JXTA(TM) technology.</P>
<P>JXTA technology is about providing a common framework, on top of
which innovative distributed computing applications can be developed.
This common framework will need to mature and become stable-staying
small, but supporting essential qualities required by a majority of
developers. A strong governance system will provide a means to manage
the process of its evolution. Initially we will build on the model
used by other open source projects, a meritocracy based on consensus.</P>
<P>All decision making, planning and communication will be done in
the open, on public mailing lists.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Roles and Responsibilities</H3>
<P>Basically the structure we envision is the following: 
</P>
<P>* Developer<BR>* Contributor<BR>* Committer<BR>* Project Owner<BR>*
Board</P>
<P><STRONG>Developers</STRONG><BR>Developers are the people who use
JXTA technology to create new JXTA-based services and applications.
Developers aren't contributing code, but they are using the shell,
reporting bugs, making feature requests and suggestions. This is by
far the most important category of people. Without developers, there
is no reason for the Project. When a developer starts to contribute
code or documentation patches, they become a contributor.</P>
<P>How to become one: <A HREF="http://download.java.net/jxta">Download
JXTA technology</A>, and use it to write code.</P>
<P><STRONG>Contributors</STRONG><BR>Contributors are developers who
contribute patches and code (by e-mail or via the appropriate project
related mailing lists/forums), and users of the JXTA software who
want to report bugs or comments. Contributors do not have CVS
check-in access. A developer who has sent in solid, useful patches on
a project can be elevated to contributor status by the project owner.
Integration of developers' contributions is at the discretion of the
project owner, but this is an iteractive, communicative process.</P>
<P>How to become one: <A HREF="http://download.java.net/jxta">Get the
source</A>, make an improvement or fix a bug, and send that code to
the developers mailing list.</P>
<P><STRONG>Committers</STRONG><BR>A committer has check-in access to
the development, or &quot;bleeding edge&quot; branch of the source
tree. Committers can directly make changes to the source base of the
development branch, from which the nightly builds are made.</P>
<P>How to become one: Submit a number of patches via e-mail, and ask
the project project owner for commit access.</P>
<P><STRONG>Project Owners</STRONG><BR>Each project has at least one
project owner. Each project owner has check-in permissions on the
stable branch of the source tree. Project owners &quot;manage&quot; a
group of contributors, and are responsible for merging these
contributors' patches, bug fixes, and new code from the development
branch of the source tree onto the stable branch. Project owners are
responsible for making sure that these contirbutions do not break the
build.</P>
<P>Project owners are responsible for the Web space for that project,
at the project home page (accessible under CVS), and for granting
check-in privileges for contributors.</P>
<P>New project owners may find useful <A HREF="http://jxta.dev.java.net/ProjectOwnerGuidelines">guidelines</A>
for running your project.</P>
<P>How to become one:</P>
<P>* <A HREF="http://www.java.net/request_project.csp">Start a
project</A> (you should have written some working code or drafts to
do this)<BR>* Have the responsibility for that project handed over to
you from the current project owner<BR>* Take over an abandoned
project<BR>* Initially, as Sun contributed the source base, the
project owners of Projects JXTA projects are the developers who
either wrote the projects, or currently have responsibility for them.
Undoubtedly, in the future, there will be non-Sun people in these
roles as well.<BR>* For ongoing projects moving here, or new projects
that are hosted here, the person who started that project or
currently maintains it is the project owner. If you start a project,
you are the project owner of that project.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sun Contributor Agreement (SCA)</STRONG></P>
<P>Any developer who wishes to become a &quot;Contributor, Committer,
and/or Project Owner&quot; -- in that he/she wishes to contribute new
code to the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) tree -- must sign and
return <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Sun's
Contributor Agreement (SCA)</A>. Please print this form out, fill in
all the necessary detail, and return it. You may also want to read
the <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/contributor_agreement.jsp">FAQ</A>.</P>

Network Circle, USCA 21-308<BR>Santa Clara, CA 95054</P>
<P>Via e-mail for scanned files:  tra<A HREF="mailto:sun_ca@sun.com">@dev.java.net<BR></A><BR><STRONG>The
Board</STRONG><BR><BR>The Board consists of three members, including
one representative selected by Sun and two independent, non-Sun
representatives who are nominated and elected by the community. The
current Board was elected in February 2006 to a term of two years.
Notice will be given of the next election on the JXTAtm Technology
<A HREF="http://jxta.dev.java.net/">homepage</A> and on the
<A HREF="mailto:discuss@jxta.dev.java.net">discuss@jxta.dev.java.net</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:announce@jxta.dev.java.net">announce@jxta.dev.java.net</A>
lists.</P>
<P>The Board has high-level duties to ensure that the JXTAtm
Technology project is being run in a fair and open manner. The Board
exists as a last resort to resolve disputes and grievances. Every
effort should be made to solve disputes at the community level before
turning to the Board.</P>
<P>We are attempting to make the governance procedures as lightweight
as possible. We seek above all to invite all interested developers to
take part in the enhancement of this project and seek input from all.
We are attempting to make sure the governance procedures will not
hinder the momentum of any group or individual who seeks to use JXTA
technology.</P>
<P>This governance system might change as the Project JXTA community
grows, but we are committed to a system that is fair and open to all
community members. If you have any questions, suggestions, and/or
concerns, please post them on the general mailing list,
<A HREF="mailto:discuss@jxta.dev.java.net">discuss@jxta.dev.java.net</A>.</P>
<P>The current elected Board members are Daniel Brookshier and
Vanessa Williams, who begin their term on March 1, 2006. The Sun
representative is Bernard Traversat.</P>
<P>* Election results from the February 2006, Board election, are
available online. The JXTA community will be holding our next
elections Spring 2008.<BR>* The term for the JXTA Board of Directors
was changed from 1 year to 2 years per community vote February
2006.<BR>* Board of Director meeting notes are available.</P>
