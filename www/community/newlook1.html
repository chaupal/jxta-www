      <p>Lately, we've been working to refresh our look a bit. You may have participated 
        in the discuss alias thread, where we discussed different "taglines" that 
        we could use. After international trademark searches, we found JXTA(TM) 
        Connected best fits our needs. A graphic artist has taken our feedback 
        and designed the four banners below. We are asking for your vote to select 
        the new banner to represent the JXTA Community. 
      <p>The chosen banner will be used on the jxta.org Web site. It will also 
        be available for people to use on their own Web sites to show affiliation 
        to Project JXTA. To show the banner on your Web site, you accept a click-through 
        agreement. This agreement makes sure people use it in a proper way (don't 
        modify it, etc...) and link it to <a href="http://www.jxta.org">www.jxta.org</a>. 
      <p align="left">Please help us make this important selection by telling 
        us what you think. Please send your comments directly to <a href="mailto:lauren.zuravleff@sun.com">Lauren 
        Zuravleff</a>, JXTA Marketing Manager at Sun Microsystems. 
      <p align="left">Thank you in advance for your feedback!

Note: Each of the banners has "Sample" written on it since it is not the final design. The banners are shown larger on this page than the final design for Web pages.
