<p>Project JXTA will be offering a tutorial for developers just starting out with 
  JXTA technology and for those who are already using JXTA for development. Come 
  learn about Project JXTA technology and our community when we get together on 
  January 8, 2004. The tutorial is offered as part of the IEEE Consumer Communications 
  and Networking Conference. </p>
<p>Start out the year on the right foot. Come join in the fun! </p>
<hr>

<p> <a href="http://www.jxta.org">Project JXTA</a> is an open network programming 
  platform to enable peer-to-peer (P2P) services and applications. Developers 
  and software vendors can freely use the JXTA Open Source technology to build 
  secure, interoperable P2P applications that can run on any connected device 
  from servers to hand-held devices. </p>
<p>The Project JXTA Tutorial will guide the participants through a complete JXTA 
  overview including project history, problem domain, feature set and available 
  resources. Subsequently, the various JXTA projects will be touched upon with 
  an emphasis on the core projects, namely Platform and Shell. As a result, the 
  class participant will be able to obtain and run the specified core projects. 
  Lastly, a number of developer focused exercises will be explained touching upon 
  JXTA Peer configuration, initialization, queries, etc. </p>
<p>Attendees will develop a clear understanding of programming distributed systems, 
  the status, available resources, and future direction of JXTA technology, as 
  well as information about the jxta.org Open Source community. Project JXTA technology 
  is both language and protocol agnostic. Our reference implementation is written 
  in Java(TM), so we will be covering both Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE)(TM) 
  for desktops and servers and Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME)(TM) for smaller 
  devices such as PDAs and cell phones. </p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Learn about P2P-style programming of distributed systems including hand-held 
    devices</li>
  <li>Examine new opportunities for P2P style distributed solutions</li>
  <li>Learn technical details about Project JXTA - Discover the latest information 
    about Project JXTA status, resources, and direction </li>
  <li>See demonstrations of example JXTA solutions </li>
  <li>Learn about development and business resources available</li>
  <li>Learn how to participate in the Open Source effort at jxta.org</li>
