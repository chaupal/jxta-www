      <p align="left">We've been working to refresh our look a bit. We liked the 
        pieces of the old page, so we wanted to keep the general layout. We wanted 
        to add more color and texture, and perhaps utilize space a bit better 
        to make it easier for you to read. 
      <p align="left">Tell us what you think. Please send your comments to <a href="mailto:helen@collab.net">Helen 
        Chen</a>, your JXTA Community Manager. Thanks for taking the time to preview 
        this page. We love hearing your thoughts!
