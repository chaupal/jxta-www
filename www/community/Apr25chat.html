<p> 
 Project JXTA is celebrating it's 1 year Anniversary on April 25, 2002.
 Here's your chance to get involved in the celebration by using myJXTA
 and chatting online with other JXTA developers from around the world!
 Ask your questions, make suggestions, or just tune in and hear what
 others are talking about. We've specified topics and times so that
 you can jump in on the conversations of interest to you. If you are
 interested in hosting another chat at a time not listed, please 
 let me know and I'll create a schedule based on your input.
