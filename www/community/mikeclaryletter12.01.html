Project JXTA went "live" a little over 6 months ago and it's been an
exciting time. As we come to the end of 2001, I wanted to highlight the
progress we have made as a community, and talk about the future as we
look forward to the New Year.
<P>
Although we started Project JXTA as a research project within Sun, it
has evolved to a full-fledged open source project with an active
developer community fueling its success.  For that the Sun JXTA team
thanks you.
<P>
Now is the right time for Project JXTA. The explosion in compute power
and connectivity has created an environment ripe for innovation, and
Project JXTA is all about enabling innovation. We believe that Project
JXTA is the open network platform that will enable P2P services and
applications to interoperate on any device across many networks. And
because JXTA is a complete set of P2P protocols, language agnostic, and
fully open, we believe that it will succeed.  So what have we all
accomplished thus far? Not only has the technology advanced, but there
are over 8000 community members, more than 50 projects and well over
350,000 downloads of the documentation, source code, and binaries.
Numerous independent developers are writing services and applications,
others are writing technical articles, several books are underway, and
JXTA technology is referenced across the web. In short: Compelling
technology, widespread adoption and rapid innovation.
<P>
As we move into 2002, Sun will continue to sponsor and actively
participate in the jxta.org community. We will continue to encourage
widespread adoption of the technology, and will be highlighting large
customer deployments as they begin integrating JXTA technology into
their business operations and next generation products.
<P>
As Bill Joy likes to say "the smartest people don't always work for
you", and "innovation happens elsewhere" - jxta.org is a true testament
to that vision. Thanks again for your hard work and commitment. We look
forward to even greater success with JXTA in 2002.
