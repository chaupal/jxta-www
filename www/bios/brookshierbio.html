      <p>Daniel Brookshier is a developer, architect, writer, mentor, community leader, speaker, editor, and teacher. Renaissance man or just <em>very</em> busy? </p>
      <p> Daniel  is a man of many hats in the JXTA and Java communities, and is known as turbogeek on both sites. He runs several open source projects that use JXTA, is on the board of directors for JXTA.org, and a community manager at several sites for Collabnet (including right here at jxta.org). He is of course a very experienced Java consultant, architecting Swing, J2EE, and JXTA with almost ten years of Java and several in JXTA P2P programming. Daniel has written several books, dozens of articles, teaches tutorials on Java and UML, and writes code for fun and profit. </p>
      <p>Daniel has some of the deepest experience in the JXTA community. From open source to commercial JXTA ventures. His commercial JXTA projects include <a href="http://www.312inc.com">312 Inc </a>, Verizon, Boeing, Quantum, Disney, and Texas Instruments. He works diligently to helping others understanding JXTA technology and working on technologies to make P2P easier to use. He is always working on presentations, example code, and articles to help his fellow JXTA developers to understand the complexities of JXTA and P2P. </p>
      <p> Daniel is also involved in the future of JXTA as a committer to the JXTA Platform and has added enhancments and bug fixes. One of his key contributions is the concept of <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Jxta/WellKnownIDs" target="_top">Well-Known-IDs</a>. </p>
      <p> Why is Daniel a JXTA champion? Because JXTA lets anyone create an internet application that does not require they buy a lot of bandwidth and computing power. The power and bandwidth can come from millions of home and work PCs instead of data centers that cost millions. With just sweat equity anyone can create their own software that could rival an EBay, Amazon, or CNN. JXTA changes the programming paradigm and the same way that the Apple II introduced the masses to computing. The Apple made it possible for the average person to write software. The power and low cost of JXTA also means anyone can benefit everyone from charities, small business, to even the fortune 500 companies on a budget. Daniel has designed multiple applications to prove this concept from file transfer and business/education tools, to games, to utilities. He has also written many of the Wiki entries for JXTA and is currently working on a set of software patterns for JXTA developers to ease client server developers into the P2P world. </p>
      <p> As an author Daniel has added to the wealth of information to help JXTA developers. His JXTA book &ldquo;JXTA: Java P2P Programming" has sections posted on Project JXTA's People project under <a href="http://people.jxta.org/turbogeek/" target="_top">'turbogeek'</a>. He also wrote &ldquo;JavaBeans Developer&rsquo;s Reference&rdquo; and &ldquo;Industrial Strength Java&rdquo;. He has also written dozens of Java articles and is one of the editors for <a href="http://www.P2Pjournal.com">P2Pjournal.com</a>. </p>
      <p> Daniel sees JXTA as a platform and the only way for a platform to succeed is by being the platform for every day applications. Part of his vision for the JXTA platform is to create applications that will spread through common services like sharing, chat, software update, and content distribution. This may sound pedestrian, but no one has created an application like this in a P2P network as free/shareware. He hopes that ultimately the concept will cause a lot more people to use the JXTA technology and thus pave the way for JXTA dominance. </p>

      <h2><a name="Daniel_and_Java_Development"> Daniel and Java Development </a></h2>
      <p>Since 1995, Daniel has been a Java developer with continuos work in various industries. Back in 1995, Daniel developed a chess engine in Java to play Chinese chess (also known as Elephant Chess or Xiang Qi). As far as he can tell, it is the first chess engine written in Java. The code is now at <href ="http://chinese-chess-xiang-qi.dev.java.net">chinese-chess-xiang-qi on java.net. Ever since, Daniel has been a part of the Java world. Daniel is just finnishing his second term as the 2004/2005 president of <a href="http://www.javamug.org">JavaMUG</a>, one of the largest Java user groups in the country. In addition he runs the JXTA P2P user group, also in Dallas. </href></p>
      <p> Daniel has worked all over the world to design and build software for various industries from travel (Sabre) to telecom (MCI Worldcom), Oil &amp; Gas (Mobil/Arco), Education (Texas Instruments) and even gaming companies (Quantum). Daniel has done contracting on special projects and is available for consulting, training, and mentoring for Java projects or object oriented design with UML. He has also worked on Java-based Expert Systems for Ericsson and The Wilmington Institute. </p>
