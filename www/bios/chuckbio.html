<P>Chuck Wegrzyn, Platform Project Owner on Project JXTA from West
Newbury, Massachusetts, spends 20 or more hours per week working on
Project JXTA. Currently he is creating a port of the Project JXTA
reference implementation in C and C++ and documenting the Project JXTA
protocols where needed to help other developers.</P>
<P>Chuck's open source community participation dates back to when he first
documented the UUCP protocols, allowing other systems (besides UNIX)
use of the protocol and fostering the wide spread adoption of Usenet.
He states that he was also the first individual to distribute GNU Emacs
over the internet and via Usenet (actually creating the idea of
breaking apart large files and zipping them.) He has participated in
the Linux and Java communities and has written and released a number of
game utilities for the Internet gaming community.</P>
<P>Chuck believes that JXTA is nicely partitioned, which allows it to be
embedded in a number of other areas. He is interested in grid computing
and enterprise workflow and sees JXTA as a means of integrating grid
computing and p2p into a single platform. He also has an idea for using
JXTA as a means of distributing massive data sets and allowing them to
be viewed as local, allowing the full use of grid technology.</P>
