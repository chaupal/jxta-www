      <img src="/branding/images/Shudo.jpg" align="LEFT"> 
      <P> Kazuyuki Shudo is known as shudo on the JXTA mailing lists. He is located 
        in Tsukuba, Japan and has been working on Project JXTA since Spring of 
        2002. He is a developer of a JXTA-based middleware project called Personal 
        Power Plant (P3). He works on JXTA Technologies about 10 hours a week. 
        He is working to improve the reference implementation (RI) of JXTA through 
        development and use of the JXTA-based middleware.
      <p>When first researching P2P technologies (Spring 2002), Shudo and the 
        GTRC/AIST team team looked into traditional technologies like Gnutella 
        which offered flooding. They, then, turned their attention to modern and 
        smart technologies like Tapestry and Pastry with DHT. In Autumn 2002, 
        they chose JXTA as the basis of their development. The reasons they selected 
        Project JXTA included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> its large user base, </li>
        <li>the stability of the API, </li>
        <li>the NAT traversal feature, </li>
        <li>the decentralized architecture and </li>
        <li>inherent scalability. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The team wanted to provide the NAT traversal feature but did not want 
        to develop their own from scratch. The team also felt that the scalability 
        of Project JXTA was an important feature for P3. Looking forward, they 
        also believed that, by basing their project on JXTA, they paved the road 
        for easy integration of new engineers, since any engineer with experience 
        in JXTA Technology would be able to smoothly start working on the project. 
        GTRC expects JXTA Technologies to continue evolving since it has such 
        incredible momentum driven by the large user base. Because P3 is based 
        on the JXTA API standard, it will remain compatible with future versions, 
        even as both P3 and JXTA Technology grows and evolves. </p>
      <p>Shudo found he could utilize JXTA's P2P abilities like identification, 
        discovery and grouping of peers and NAT traversal, without development 
        of our own similar P2P infrastructure. This means that JXTA could be applied 
        to P3 even though one of its goals is high-performance computing and different 
        from usual P2P software. To his company, this is a big advantage because 
        they could hire engineers who have an experience on using JXTA and they 
        could smoothly start working on their project. This is an advantage of 
        using JXTA's established API.</p>
      <p>When asked about his vision for JXTA technology he says &quot;Vast number 
        of devices, software and computers support our life more widely and essentially. 
        JXTA may be the technology which enables such a society and otherwise 
        it has made an impact on the vision.&quot; In the near future he hopes 
        that JXTA technology will become more scalable, high-performance and light-weight. 
        They are important for the purposes of P3.</p>
      <p>He is the developer of a Java JIT <a href="http://www.shudo.net/jit/">compiler 
        shuJIT</a>. The JIT is for x86 processors / Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD. 
        It has been distributed and widely used since 1998.There have been been 
        over 12,000 downloads.</p>
      <p>He is very interested in distributed computing and related programming. 
        He has also developed a transparent distributed object system MetaVM, 
        which is based on shuJIT, and MOBA, a Java thread migration software. 
        Both are distributed technologies and freely downloadable.</p>
      <p>He says he is enjoying life with his wife and working as a research scientist. 
        His technical interests are on distributed computing, programming language 
        and information security. He spends free time hacking software, whistling 
        and driving. </p>
