Mat Dietrich, AIsland Project Owner on Project JXTA from London, UK, spends
most of his free time working on <a href="http://aisland.jxta.org">AIsland</a>.
The project's goal is to provide a framework to build and distribute
agents. 
<P>
Mat works as solutions architect for Internet solutions provider
<a href="http://www.netdecisions.com">Netdecisions Ltd.</a>,  building web 
enabled Enterprise Applications.
He believes Agents are a step towards a new Programming Paradigm, which
builds on Machine Learning and will one day result in Genetic Algorithms.
He would like to see a network of machines win the Turing Test sooner rather
than later.
<P>
In the early 1970's, Mat started programming by writing Assembler. After 
finishing high school he became an audio engineer. After a successful career
in the German music business, Mat moved to London where he discovered the
Internet in 1995 and decided to turn his hobby into his profession.
<P>
Mat's vision for Project JXTA is that it will become the standard mechanism
for connecting peers. He believes that it is necessary to 
find an alternative to the client/server model to allow the many devices
created from new emerging technologies to talk to each other.
<P>
You can reach Mat at <a href="mailto:mat@mdo.co.uk">mat@mdo.co.uk</a> or 
on the Project JXTA discuss mailing
list.
