<P>
 Dorothea Wiarda dedicates 10-15 hours per week as a committer
 on the shell and instant p2p projects.  She's added a history command
 and command line editing to the JXTA shell application. Currently,
 she's working on adding new features to the GUI for the Instantp2p
 application. Dorothea's involvement in Open Source communities has
 mainly been on the client side. She is <a
 href="http://www.dwiarda.com">self-employed</a> her current contract
 involves, among other things, installation of open source projects.
<P>
   Dorothea would like to see (and be involved in) more user friendly
   JXTA application programs like shell, instantp2p and others. She
   says that these programs should be usable by non-developers. She
   would also like to see good  documentation for the API with enhanced
   tutorial material, which would allow Project JXTA and it's potential
   developers to be showcased for larger distributed projects. It
   would also  provide a stable basis for further development.
<P>
   Dorothea envisions the future of JXTA technology to play a
   significant role in distributed scientific applications, where peers
   advertise that they have certain model simulations programs
   installed and are willing to allow other peers to run these
   applications. An example of this might be large network
   calculations which model all the reactions involved in the rapid
   proton capture process, the origin of many proton-rich elements.
   This is a description of an explosive stellar environment.
