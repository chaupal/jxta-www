Vanessa is co-founder, CTO, and Chief Architect of <a href="http://www.oponia.com">Oponia Networks, Inc.</a>, a Toronto-based software start-up developing distributed applications for the consumer and enterprise markets. She has over nineteen years of experience in software development and consulting, largely in scientific and engineering applications. She has worked in a wide range of industries and environments including: chemical process control, atomic energy research, collaborative multi-media, engineering document management, and defense. As CTO of MacLaren McCann Interactive, Canada's first and most successful interactive agency, she spent the dot-com boom and bust managing the development of really really large websites, and now knows more than she ever wanted to know about advertising.

Vanessa has been a member of project JXTA since the Spring of 2001. She is a committer on the platform, as well as the owner of the jxtaSpaces project. Mostly she has concentrated on making improvements to the performance of the JxtaSocket implementation, including the reliability layer. In the near future, she expects to focus on peer reflection, profiling, and super-peer promotion, starting with the relay service. In the future, Vanessa would like to see more work done on defining and documenting best (or at least proven) practices for application architecture using JXTA. If she had the time, she'd love to collaborate on a book on the subject.

JXTA appeals to her because it provides just enough of a framework to lower the entry barriers for developers wishing to build real-world distributed applications. Its language-, platform-, and network- neutrality are huge advantages not seen with other distributed programming toolkits. JXTA's super-peer architecture reflects the network "as built" more realistically than pure peer-to-peer designs. Furthermore, the peer group concept allows for intelligent scoping of services and applications using the same framework, and even the same infrastructure. The fact that all of the services can be replaced with customized ones means that there are no limits to what JXTA can be used to build--other than an architect's imagination. The existence of JXTA has seemed to stimulate research in important areas of distributed application architecture, and has opened pathways for commercial application development as well.

With regard to Open Source, Vanessa has long been an advocate of adopting Open Source software inside the enterprise, and has frequently included Open Source software in client solutions. She has also been an Apache Contributor, having made a small contribution to the XML Database project once upon a time.
