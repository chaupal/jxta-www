Francesco Russo began working on Project JXTA in September 2001.
He's involved with the integration of Anthill with Project JXTA.
<a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/anthill/">Anthill</a> is a research project in peer-to-peer computing directed by
Prof. Ozalp Babaoglu and Dott. Alberto Montresor.
<P>
The Distributed Systems Group at the University of Bologna is
developing Anthill, a framework to support the design, implementation
and evaluation of P2P applications  based on ideas such as multi-agent
and evolutionary programming  borrowed from CAS (Complex Adaptive
Systems).  An Anthill system consists of a dynamic network of peer
nodes (nests); societies of adaptive agents (ants) travel through this
network, interacting with nodes and cooperating with other agents in
order to solve complex problems. Anthill can be used to construct
different classes of P2P services that exhibit resilience, adaptation
and self-organization properties.  Francesco's main task is to develop
Anthill Nests using the JXTA platform.  He thinks the University will
be also using CMS for managing resources within the Anthill group of
Nests.
<P>
Francesco says that Project JXTA has many possibilities and could be
the software basis for the next computing era.  He is very interested
in the facilities offered by JXTA, which have proven to be very useful
in the development of Anthill. He is also interested in several
subprojects hosted on the jxta.org web site.
