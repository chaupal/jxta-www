          <td><p><a href="mailto:akms_mail@yahoo.com">Muhammed Saleem Adookkattil</a>, also known as amsaleem on the JXTA mailing lists, is located in Dallas, Texas. He joined the community September 2004 and is currently a committer in the jxta-c project. He spends about 60% of his time working with JXTA Technology. This is the first Open Source community that Saleem has joined and actively participated. </p>
          <p>Although he has joined the JXTA Community only a few short months ago, he has already made many important contributions to the code. </p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Some areas where Saleem has made contributions include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> stop and release of jxta modules in jxta-c project </li>
        <li> jxta messaging bug fixes </li>
        <li>object/memory leaks</li>
        <li>miscellaneous threading/sychronization issues</li>
      </ol>      
      <p>When Saleem was first researching P2P technologies for his development, he looked at Kazaa. He chose JXTA Technology because of the ability to communicate with remote peer behind firewall and platform independence. He found that using 
      JXTA protocols enable developers to build and deploy interoperable P2P services and applications. He particularly appreciates the  both programming language and transport protocols independance.</p>
      <p>In the future, he expects to see improved reliability and usability as JXTA Technology matures.<br>
