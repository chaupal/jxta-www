   The Red Herring wrote of Bill Joy, "If the Red Herring had the job of
starting the computer industry all over again and we could pick five players
living  today to pull it off, Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy would
be on that team."</p>
       
      <p>Bill received a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University 
of Michigan and a MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from U.C.Berkeley,
where he was the principal designer of Berkeley UNIX (BSD). The Berkeley
version of UNIX became the standard in education and research, garnering
development support from DARPA, and was notable for introducing virtual memory
and internet- working using TCP/IP to UNIX. BSD was widely  distributed in
source form so that others could learn from it and improve it; this style
of software distribution has now led to the "open source" movement, of which
BSD is now recognized to be one of the earliest examples.  </p>
       
      <p>For his work on Berkeley UNIX, Bill received the ACM Grace Murray 
Hopper Award which is given for outstanding work in Computer Science done 
when the recipient is under the age of thirty. In 1993, Joy was given the 
Lifetime Achievement Award of the USENIX Association, "For profound intellectual
 achievement and unparalleled services to the UNIX community." Bill joined 
Sun from Berkeley in 1982, and has led Sun's technical strategy, spearheading
 its open systems philosophy. In the mid 1980's he designed Sun's Network 
File System(NFS), and was a co-designer of the SPARC microprocessor architecture. 
In the 1990's Joy "left the urgent behind to get to the important," to create 
and head up Aspen Smallworks, a small Sun R&amp;D lab in Colorado.  </p>
       
      <p>In the early 1990's he did the basic pipeline design of UltraSparc-I 
and its multimedia processing features. This basic pipeline is the one used 
in all of Sun's SPARC microprocessors shipping today. In the mid 1990's Bill 
lead the initial business and technical strategy for Sun's Java programming 
language and platform, and co-authored the book "The Java Language Specification" 
which precisely described it. Wired magazine described Java as "the most
important development in computing since the explosion of the Internet."
 </p>
       
      <p>In the late 1990's Bill and the Smallworks staff started the Jini 
project, a revolutionary interconnection technology for networking computer 
devices, for which they developed the Sun Community Source Licensing (SCSL) 
model, which adds to the traditional open source model a intellectual property
 framework designed to guarantee the compatibility that is needed in a highly 
networked world.  </p>
       
      <p>In 1997, Joy was appointed by President Clinton as Co-Chairman of 
the Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC). The Advisory
 Committee is providing guidance and advice on all areas of high-performance 
computing, communications and information technologies to accelerate development 
andnadoption of information technologies that will be vital for American prosperity
in the twenty-first century. The report of the committee is available at
http://www.hpcc.gov/ac.  </p>
       
      <p>Bill was appointed as Chief Scientist of Sun in 1998. His current 
main activities are research into simple reliable and secure distributed systems,
public policy in science and information technology, and helping set the
strategic technology direction for Sun as a member of the Executive Committee.
 </p>
       
      <p>Bill is the co-recipient, with Andy Bechtolsheim (also a co-founder 
of Sun and now a VP at Cisco systems) of the Computerworld Smithsonian award 
for Innovation in 1999. Bill has been inducted to the 1999 Computer Museum 
Industry Hall of Fame and received the PC Magazine 1999 Lifetime Achievement 
Award. Bill is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow 
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  </p>
       
      <p>As part of his public policy role as Chief Scientist, Bill has been 
investigating the nature of the emerging 21st century sciences and technologies. 
His cover article in the April, 2000 issue of Wired Magazine, entitled "Why 
the Future Doesn't Need Us" has ignited a worldwide discussion of some dangers 
from and ethical issues in the development of these technologies.  </p>
       
      <p>Bill enjoys skiing, hiking and theatre, and is an avid reader. He 
is a member of the Board of Directors of the Novell Corporation. </p>

   Chuck Wegrzyn, Platform Project Owner on Project JXTA from West Newbury, 
Massachusetts, spends 20 or more hours per week working on Project JXTA. Currently
he is creating a port of the Project JXTA reference implementation in C and
C++ and documenting the Project JXTA protocols where needed to help other
developers.</p>
         
      <p>Chuck's open source community participation dates back to when he 
first documented the UUCP protocols, allowing other systems (besides UNIX)
 use of the protocol and fostering the wide spread adoption of Usenet. He 
states that he was also the first individual to distribute GNU Emacs over 
the internet and via Usenet (actually creating the idea of breaking apart 
large files and zipping them.) He has participated in the Linux and Java communities
and has written and released a number of game utilities for the Internet
gaming community.</p>
         
      <p>Chuck believes that JXTA is nicely partitioned, which allows it to
be embedded in a number of other areas. He is interested in grid computing
 and enterprise workflow and sees JXTA as a means of integrating grid computing 
and p2p into a single platform. He also has an idea for using JXTA as a means 
of distributing massive data sets and allowing them to be viewed as local, 
allowing the full use of grid technology.</p>

    Jeff Scheider has been a Project JXTA community member since April 25, 
2001. Jeff Schneider, architectural contributor to the Platform Project, has
been dedicating 25 hours per week to Project JXTA since it went live on April
25, 2001. He has been prioritizing tasks, documenting architecture and doing
some performance engineering on the core.  He looks forward to the day when
JXTA technology becomes the primary vehicle for peer-based communication -
when going to the JXTAnet is as common as using a browser.</p>
          
      <p>Jeff, a resident of Austin, Texas, was the author of the first Enterprise 
Java book and one of the original writers for the Java Developers Journal. 
 He is also the founder of Momentum Software, the premier Java consultancy 
in Texas and is now the founder of Resilient Edge, maker of the first Enterprise 
Peer Platform being rolled out on JXTA technology.</p>

   Ziad El Kurjie of Palo Alto, California. Ziad has been a member of the 
 community since April. He is the project owner for RRS and is a committer 
on the Platform and Shell projects. Ziad El Kurjie has been involved in numerous 
peer-to-peer open protocols including Gnutella and OpenNap, and now Project 
JXTA. He is the head of engineering at Clip2, where he has driven formulation 
and execution of the Clip2 contribution to Project JXTA. He dedicates about 
40 hours a week to Project JXTA.  </p>
       
      <p>Since early April, Ziad and Clip2 have turned their attention to 
the network that JXTA peers will run on; its topology, dynamics, and performance
 implications. By understanding those attributes of the JXTA network, they 
were able to write code to crawl the network, graph its topology and monitor
 its components. Recently, Clip2 started reporting some of that data on the 
      <a href="http://www.clip2.com">Clip2 web site.</a> This work led Clip2 
to develop the <a href="http://rrs.jxta.org">Remote Rendezvous Service (RRS)</a>, 
software that facilitates management and utilization of rendezvous peers.
  </p>
       
      <p>According to Ziad, Project JXTA has introduced a common platform 
for the technical community to evolve in ways that make it possible to design 
and build applications in peer-to-peer models. He's quite psyched to see implementations
on platforms of varying architectures such as palm and wireless,  as it opens
up the scope of the solutions the community would introduce. The network
is quite bigger and looks so different, all of a sudden!   </p>
       
      <p>Ziad sees peer-to-peer computing playing a role in the next wave 
of information discovery and archival applications. Project JXTA's efforts 
should further solidify the implementation of the common transports, while 
new services can be developed to tie application specific architectures into 
the core. His technical interests revolve around network management and data 
discovery. Project JXTA stands as a ripe environment for the implementation 
of some known techniques in the new model, while opening up the opportunity 
for new solutions to be figured out and incorporated into commercial systems.

      <p>Oso started on Project JXTA on April 25, 2001. He spends approximately
 10% of his time on Project JXTA, attempting to merge the existing P2P efforts 
(like Gnutella) with Project JXTA. Oso wants to encourage community involvement 
to make sure that Project JXTA is not a stand-alone effort by Sun. He would 
like to see Project JXTA fit into the large picture and find it's proper place
in the P2P landscape.</p>
          
      <p>Oso thinks that Project JXTA has an excellent chance of forming a
set of P2P paradigms and generally accepted XML constructs that might be
 useful to the P2P community as a whole. According to Oso, Project JXTA can 
define the 'language' of the P2P, if it only manages to gain the wide acceptance 
in the P2P circles. He says that in order to do so, Project JXTA has to concentrate 
on what it does best, defining the P2P-specific semantical primitives and 
leveraging the existing concepts (like Gnutella routing or SOAP/XML-RPC) whenever
possible.</p>

    Dedicating between 15 and 20 hours per week to Project JXTA, Vanessa
Williams is a general contributor to the discussion mailing list and the

project once it's further along. She is trying to build a Distributed Shared
Memory Service for peer co-ordination on top of the JXTA technology.  Although
this service could facilitate the building of a variety of applications with
JXTA, she hopes to use it to create semantically rich, distributed search
services which adapt to individuals and communities of interest.</p>
          
      <p>Vanessa would like to see more applications and services to demonstrate
 Project JXTA's capabilities to the developer community at large, and to
identify where the JXTA community needs to do more work. She hopes Project
JXTA will allow developers to build sophisticated distributed applications
without having to build all of the infrastructure (e.g. peer discovery and
communication) from scratch. She is fascinated by the idea of JXTA Peer Group
Services, and how they can be used to build reliable distributed services
accessible to any network peer.</p>
          
      <p>Vanessa's involvement with Open Source has mostly been at the level

<p>  Raffi Krikorian, of Cambridge, Massachusetts started on Project JXTA 
on April 4, 2001. He spends about 20 hours a week as a Committer on the RRS,
  Shell, Platform projects and a Contributor on the Security project. He
 works for <a href="http://www.clip2.com">Clip2</a> where he had been  involved 
in the development of a load testing application to stress  test the JXTA 
platform. Clip2 has also developed the remote rendezvous  service whereby 
which rendezvous operators can simply deploy peers  around the network and 
manage them all remotely and via the JXTA  technology.   </p>
 
<p>  Aside from this, Raffi has also made some miscellaneous patches to the
  Platform and the Shell projects. His future plans include designing  and 
implementing the <a href="http://rrs.jxta.org/secure-rrs.html">secure rrs</a> 
  and adding support for advertisement expiry into the core.    Raffi has 
also written the <a
 href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2001/04/25/jxta.html">"hello jxta!" 
  tutorial</a> for O'Reilly --   the first published  <a
 href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/p2pweb2001/view/e_sess/1791"> 
  tutorial</a> on how to build a JXTA technology application.      At JavaOne, 
he was a participant on the JXTA community BoF panel at JavaOne,   and also 
covered both nights of JXTA BoFs for O'Reilly -- take a look   at the articles

Manager, at the O'Reilly P2P Conference this September.   </p>
 
<p>   Raffi envisions Project JXTA to be a middleware layer for many   different 
P2P systems each talking to each other via the JXTA   protocols. He believes 
JXTA will have to borrow heavily from other   currently existing technologies 
in order to succeed following an   "embrace, and extend" philosophy. (In order
to be successful, he   thinks that the JXTA technology will have to mate
properly with other   P2P systems and possibly act as a bridge between different
systems.)  Raffi says that the main strength for the JXTA technology may
lie in  the wireless P2P community -- at its core JXTA technology is designed
 for unreliable and asynchronous communications, both of which occur   readily
in the wireless systems.  </p>

<p> Nick thinks that Project JXTA has 2 purposes: </p>
 
<ol>
  <li>Project JXTA provides a conceptual framework for people to think about 
P2P systems.  There are many conceptual constructs in the JXTA technology 
that are very basic in the P2P world. The JXTA technology provides a common 
and flexible architecture, so that programmers don't have to re-think such 
issues when they design a P2P system. Even if Project JXTA doesn't go mainstream, 
it will provide a valuable model for people to evaluate and analyze P2P systems.
  </li>
   <li> Project JXTA defines a common semantic on which P2P systems are built. 
P2P systems are so diverse and their algorithms so sophisticated, that the 
practicality of this goal remains to be seen. Nevertheless, Project JXTA is
an aggressive step towards this direction.

<p> At Improv Technologies, Marko and others are currently working on a component 
development system designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and maintenance 
of cross-platform and cross-device networked and distributed applications. 
They are using Project JXTA as their platform neutral inter-peer message and

done at Improv. </p>
 
<p> Coming from a background in large-scale distributed simulation, Marko
 would like to see JXTA technology become the one of the "standard" mechanisms 
to have heterogeneous devices share information and digital services on the 
network.  He hopes that Project JXTA, along with the current security and 
monitoring projects can truly enable peer-to-peer information and digital 
service exchange to occur in a robust, consistent, traceable and secure manner.
 </p>
 
<p> Marko is anxiously awaiting some real-world JXTA based applications and
 projects beyond the current file sharing and search ones we see now. He
wants to see more "real-time" (or at least near real-time) distributed applications 
that use the JXTA technology.  He feels that new types of distributed applications, 
or at least those that make better use of network resources, are just beginning 
to appear on the horizon and that we are just about to enter a new era of 
distributed computing.  Marko hopes that JXTA technology helps make this a
reality. </p>

   </p>
   
  <p>Philippe Coupe frequently commutes between Europe and the USA. He became 
     a member of the Project JXTA community on May 2, 2001. Philippe is co-Project 
     Owner for the payment service and has been active on <a
 href="mailto:discuss@jxta.org">discuss@jxta.org</a>.      He dedicates at 
least 30% of his time to Project JXTA.</p>
       
  <p> Philippe is the CEO of IPassport Corporation, the company that operates 
     the <a href="http://www.epocketcash.com/">EPocketCash</a> payment system. 
     He thinks that the p2p industry needs a payment system to allow the creation
     of a whole new industry/market. Since 1996, he's envisioned a world
where      anybody can pay and get paid in real-time without any risk or
fraud, without      giving any unneeded "private information" to other parties,
and by using any      kind of terminal (or software). These are the reasons
he offered to make JXTA      "EPocketCash Ready" and asked to manage the
"payment service project".    </p>
   
  <p> In the next 2 years, Philippe sees three major internet applications: 
Email,      Web and P2P (All these services being operated through public 
domain software      like SMTP and Apache). He says that no one will want 
to reinvent the wheel      and JXTA will be the "P2P platform" and instead 
will concentrate their efforts      on the application layer. Philippe thinks 
that JXTA can be the "Apache" of      the P2P services - that JXTA will serve 
many different kinds of applications,      and not only "Internet Messenger" 
or "Napster-like" file sharing.    </p>
   
  <p> Philippe says that JXTA can also become a networked operating system 
(read      his email <a
 href="http://www.jxta.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=9243&amp;listName=discuss">"RE:[JXTA 
     discuss] Global architecture proposal (and maybe some sci-fi)"</a> dated 
6/10/01).      In short, he sees JXTA as a platform able to offer internet 
services in a      much better way than .Net (EPocketCash will also support 
.Net and SOAP)    </p>
   
  <p> According to Philippe, JXTA, as the first P2P platform with a payment 
system      ("EPocketCash Ready"), allows the creation of many different kind
of services      served by lots of contributors and companies. Because it
will be possible      to pay and get paid through JXTA (and EPocketCash), 
we will see the creation      of a completely new industry offering lots of
services through the JXTA network.    </p>

to      initiate the CMS, InstantP2P and monitoring Projects. Kuldip recently 
initiated      the JXME project to implement JXTA technology on small devices. 
Meanwhile,      he's been getting involved with the Project JXTA community 
and encouraging      it's members to participate and make Project JXTA successful.</p>
       
  <p>Kuldip thinks that Project JXTA is an excellent concept to provide building 
     blocks for P2P solutions. Although it's still is in it's infancy, he 
envisions      the Project JXTA community driving the technology toward becoming 
the "solution"      for enterprises in the future.</p>

  Brendon J. Wilson of      Vancouver, BC, Canada, is a Senior Software Engineer 
at PKI Innovations, Inc.      He spends 40 hours a week on Project JXTA, as
he is the author of an upcoming      book on JXTA from New Riders. You can
read the first few chapters of the book      that have been released to the
jxta.org community at www.brendonwilson.com/projects/jxta.      Future chapters
will also be posted to that web site. Brendon divides his      time between
writing the book and contributing to the discussions on the discuss@jxta.org 
     mailing list. He hopes that this will not only help him get some early 
feedback      on the book, but it will also help the Project JXTA community 
accelerate the      adoption of the JXTA technology by providing another resource
to jumpstart      new programmers.    </p>
   
  <p> In addition to his interest in Project JXTA, Brendon was the original 
Lead      Developer on the encrypted web-mail service, HushMail.com, which 
uses a Java      applet to provide end-to-end encrypted email from any web 
browser. This product's      source code was made available to the public 
to enable a public review for      security holes (see www.hush.ai or www.brendonwilson.com/projects/hushmail). 
   </p>
   
  <p> Brendon's personal pet peeve is inefficiency. He says that the fragmented 
     and proprietary nature of existing P2P solutions flys in the face of 
what      he believes is P2P core purpose: allowing people to leverage existing 
resources      to the maximum level possible. What's the point of creating 
communication/networking      technology applications if they can't speak 
to each other? Gnutella, Napster,      and other pioneering P2P applications 
have shown us the massive untapped potential      currently locked away in 
devices at the edge of the Internet, but have also      erected artificial 
walls between their users, partially defeating the purpose      of P2P. 
  </p>
   
  <p> Brendon believes JXTA technology will take P2P to the next level, smashing 
     down these artifical walls to build a new economy based on sharing resources, 
     and therefore ideas, without restriction. The free exchange of ideas 
is the      founding concept of both P2P and democracy; JXTA technology has 
the capability      to put power back in the hands of ordinary end users.

  Francesco Russo of      Bologna, Italy started studying the specifications 
of the JXTA technology      last May and spends approximately 60% of his time
on the Project. He began      working on Project JXTA in September 2001. He's
involved with the integration      of <a
 href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/anthill/">Anthill</a> with Project 
     JXTA. Anthill is a research project in peer-to-peer computing directed 
by      Prof. Ozalp Babaoglu and Dott. Alberto Montresor.    </p>
   
  <p> The Distributed Systems Group at the University of Bologna is developing 
     Anthill, a framework to support the design, implementation and evaluation 
     of P2P applications based on ideas such as multi-agent and evolutionary 
programming      borrowed from CAS (Complex Adaptive Systems). An Anthill 
system consists of      a dynamic network of peer nodes (nests); societies 
of adaptive agents (ants)      travel through this network, interacting with 
nodes and cooperating with other      agents in order to solve complex problems. 
Anthill can be used to construct      different classes of P2P services that 
exhibit resilience, adaptation and      self-organization properties. Francesco's 
main task is to develop Anthill      Nests using the JXTA platform. He thinks 
the University will be also using      CMS for managing resources within the
Anthill group of Nests.    </p>
   
  <p> Francesco says that Project JXTA has many possibilities and could be 
the      software basis for the next computing era. He is very interested 
in the facilities      offered by JXTA, which have proven to be very useful

  <p>Daniel Brookshier is a committer on the Platform, CMS and XML-RPC projects. 
     Most of his time is dedicated to understanding the JXTA technology and 
he      uncovers issues in the code along the way. He is active on the discuss 
mailing      list and is currently working on code for the authenticator service
used to      validate credentials in messages. He is very interested in the
JXTA technology      and making it the best it can be.    </p>
   
  <p> Many years ago, Daniel wrote a chess engine in Java to play Chinese 
chess      (also known as Elephant Chess or Xianqi). As far as he can tell, 
it is the      first chess engine written in Java. He has started a Chinese 
chess project      on SourceForge and will be maintaining the code there. 
His plans include integrating      JXTA to improve the performance and add 
human-to-human capabilities.    </p>
   
  <p> Daniel is currently the lead author of a JXTA book for Sams Publishing. 
     Sections of the book will be posted on Project JXTA's People project 
under      'turbogeek'. That folder will also contain UML diagrams and example 
code.      In addition, he is creating a slide presentation on JXTA that will
be presented      to his Java user group.    </p>
   
  <p> Daniel sees JXTA as a platform and the only way for a platform to succeed 
     is by being popular. Part of his vision for the JXTA platform is to create
     applications that will spread the core JXTA components. One project (part
     of the book that he's writing) is a calendar and address book for JXTA.
The      application would use JXTA to first link your PDA, home PC, and
work PC so      that your data is synchronized automatically. Secondarily 
the system would      allow for sharing of addresses between members. Finally 
the system would allow      you to interact with other member's calendars 
to make appointments and announce      events. The system uses Xcal, vCard, 
and SyncML to be compatible with most      PDA systems and software. Daniel 
says that this may sound pedestrian, but      no one has created an application 
like this in a P2P network as freeware.      He hopes that ultimately the 
concept will cause a lot more people to use the      JXTA technology and thus
pave the way for JXTA dominance.    </p>
   
  <p> Daniel says that Project JXTA represents an ability to create rich applications
     without servers. For many years he has had projects that were shelved
because      they required tens of thousands or even millions of dollars
for equipment.      With JXTA, the peers share server tasks and costs are
insignificant.    </p>
