      <P> Jeffrey Altman has been a member of the jxta.org community since April 
        2001. He was elected to the JXTA <a href="http://www.jxta.org/community/board/boardrules.html">Board 
        of Directors</a> in 2002. He's one of the owners of the <a href="http://spec.jxta.org/">Spec 
        project</a> and a contributor on the <a href="http://platform.jxta.org/">Java 
        Platform</a> and <a href="http://security.jxta.org/">Security</a> projects. 
        Jeffrey has done extensive work with JXTA Security to define security 
        architecture. He presented a talk at JavaOne <a href="http://www.jxta.org/JavaOne/JavaOne2002/JXTAp2pSecurity.pdf">Virtual 
        Transport Layer Security</a>. He dedicates to Project JXTA as much time 
        as he can afford and still pay for beer. 
      <p>Jeffrey's involvement in JXTA is not merely academic. He was the Director 
        of Networking and Security Technologies at Internet Access Methods, www.iamethods.com 
        and www.iam-there.com, which (prior to its closure) developed a wide array 
        of technologies in Real-Time Interactive User Interfaces. IAM technologies 
        include IAM-&gt;Developing a collaborative Integrated Development Environment 
        and IAM-&gt;Swinging which enables Collaboration from any Swing/AWT GUI 
        component.</p>
      <p>In January 2004, Jeffrey founded <a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com">Secure 
        Endpoints Inc</a>. Secure Endpoints Inc. is focused on the development 
        of open source standards based mechanisms for the secure exchange of information 
        between peers. In addition to his participation in the JXTA community, 
        Jeffrey is a core team member of MIT's Kerberos Group; a Gatekeeper in 
        the <a href="http://openafs.org/">OpenAFS.org</a> community; and an <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/kitten-charter.html">IETF 
        Working Group</a> chair in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html#Security%20Area">Security 
        Area</a>.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey believes Project JXTA provides a new networking framework for 
        use in developing both managed peer to peer communities as well as completely 
        ad-hoc peer networks. He says JXTA will provide the necessary constructs 
        for a universal secure notion of identity that will allow subsequent generations 
        of collaborative applications and distributed services to be implemented. 
        JXTA has the potential for completely rewriting the rules by which computer 
        software and services are sold, developed, and distributed.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey thinks that communications between networked devices will become 
        highly localized both by logical grouping of entities and within physical 
        space. The typical examples include the distributed calendar shared by 
        your PDA, alarm clock, and office systems; and the wireless mall where 
        upon entry to the grounds your PDA picks up the map of the mall, locations 
        of empty parking spaces, the times and availabilities of films at the 
        theater, menus for restaurants, sales at various shops, plus the necessary 
        tools to order tickets, make reservations, etc. In both cases, the communications 
        are bi-directional and completely peer oriented. In one case, the networks 
        are managed peers and in the second ad-hoc.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey says that the current focus of the media is on peer-to-peer systems 
        which are designed to provide users anonymous private mechanisms, most 
        frequently used to trade in media content. The most likely result of a 
        wide spread distributed peer to peer infrastructure based on JXTA is a 
        network that provides for strong privacy but lacks anonymity (at least 
        in the sense that all peers have a well defined secure identity.) This 
        allows JXTA to be used as the basis for transactions between peers as 
        a form of trade. This should have widespread implications for the exchange 
        of products and services in all industries not to mention significantly 
        alter the way we live our day to day lives.</p>
