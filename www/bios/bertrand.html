      <p>Bertrand Goetzmann lives in Mouans-Sartoux which is located in the Alpes-Maritimes. 
        He currently works in Antibes which is nearby. You may know him better 
        by his JXTA username, bgoetzmann. He is a frequent contributor to the 
        mailing lists. He has been a member of our community since early 2003. 
      </p>
      <p>Although he doesn't have a role in the core JXTA projects yet, he spends 
        a great deal of time working with JXTA technology. He estimates that one 
        third of his free time is spent on JXTA! You can see some of his ideas 
        at his website <a href="http://www.object-everywhere.com">OBJECT-EVERYWHERE</a>. 
        He created this site for developers. He created a special area for JXTA 
        technology at <a href="http://www.object-everywhere.com/JXTAWorks/index.htm">JXTAWorks</a>. 
        He has currently developed four JXTA applications. His main goal in doing 
        this development work is to promote this powerful technology by supplying 
        example applications, with source code, that one can launch using Java 
        Web Start.<br>
        <br>
        When Betrand was began researching P2P technologies, JXTA technology attracted 
        him because it is Open Source and because of the design fundamentals such 
        as XML protocols, network independence, etc. He feels that the benefits 
        of using JXTA technology are well summarized by the word &quot;independence&quot; 
        as we find in the sentence given by <a href="http://www.jxta.org/bios/jamestoddbio.html">James 
        Todd</a> : 
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote>
          <p> <i><b>Java == platform independence, XML == application independence, 
            JXTA == network independence</b></i><br>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>            <br>
            Bertrand's vision for JXTA technology is for a large adoption in desktop 
            applications to enable more collaboration. He adds &quot;I hope that 
            Project JXTA will be great success.&quot; <br>
            <br>
      When he's not working on JXTA technologies, he spends his free time working 
      on Object-Oriented conception and new technologies such as Java Data Objects 
      and Aspect-Oriented Programming.
