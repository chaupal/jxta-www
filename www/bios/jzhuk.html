      <P> Jeff Zhuk has been a member of the JXTA Community since November 2003. 
        You may know him as &quot;jzhuk&quot; on the JXTA Community discussion 
        lists. He spends about 20% of his time working with JXTA Technology from 
        his office in Denver, Colorado. 
      <P>Working on the Knowledge Alliances project with advanced security (Patent 
        Pending), he originally became interested in centralized (web-based) solutions, 
        but knew that it would not scale for growing knowledge and networks. JXTA 
        offered the way to distributed solutions. He also looked at Groove technology 
        as another p2p solution. He chose JXTA Technologies because: 
      <ul>
        <li>JXTA protocols have full potential for creating distributed self-healing 
          networks</li>
        <li>JXTA protocols include possibilities for multi-level privileges to 
          access services and data</li>
        <li>JXTA protocols and some JXTA implementations are open to the public</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jeff notes that JXTA can help us to move into a new world of distributed 
        knowledge and services where new types of applications (and related jobs 
        :-) will be available. He thinks that in many areas, like processing multiple 
        forms of security data, or working in educational environment, where knowledge 
        sharing and integration is extremely important, distributed knowledge 
        networks is the best and probably the only real solution for growing complexity 
        of information and related services. JXTA is a perfect fit for communications 
        between students working on a team project, between students and instructors, 
        between researchers that need to share knowledge and resources. He sees 
        JXTA technologies as a potential mainstream solution for distributed network 
        implementations. </p>
      <p>He is also a member of OpenCyc.org, an ontology related project. OpenCyc 
        is the open source version of <a href="http://www.cyc.com/cyc/opencyc/overview">Cyc 
        technology</a>, the world's largest and most complete general knowledge 
        base and commonsense reasoning engine. </p>
      <p>Jeff is the president of <a href="http://javaschool.com/school/references.html">ITSchool, 
        Inc</a>. He is a software architect, educator, and developer with over 
        twenty years of experience, and a speaker at Java One and Wireless One 
        conferences. Jeff has numerous patents and publications, teaches at the 
        University of Phoenix and at DeVry University, and conducts corporate 
        consulting and training in XML, Java, WAP, Distributed Networks, and Knowledge 
        Engineering. His recent book &#147;<a href="http://javaschool.com/school/public/web/books">Integration-Ready 
        Architecture and Design</a>&#148; by Cambridge University Press bridges 
        the gap for a new generation of software technologies and teaches a set 
        of skills that are becoming extremely valuable today, and which will certainly 
        be in high demand tomorrow. At the<a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/index.jsp"> 
        Java One International Conference</a> Jeff will present a session on &#147;<a href="http://www.javaone04.com/catalog/controller/catalog">Distributed 
        life in JXTA knowledge networks</a>&quot;. </p>
      <p>A former mountain climber, he likes to ski and hike in the Rocky Mountains.
