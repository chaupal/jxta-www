        <img src="/branding/images/jerome3.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"> Jerome Verbeke, 
        known on the Project JXTA mailing lists as <a href="mailto:jerome@jxta.org">jerome</a>, 
        works for Sun in the Menlo Park facility. He is the owner of <a href="jngi.jxta.org">JNGI</a> 
        and is a committer on <a href="ezel.jxta.org">EZEL</a>. He describes the 
        current amount of time he spends on JXTA as &quot;not enough!&quot; Jerome 
        started using JXTA technology in early 2001 when he began working on a 
        distributed computing project which was to become JNGI. Project JXTA was 
        an obvious choice for this project since it appeared to be developing 
        as the leading peer-to-peer standard at the time. </p>
      <p>The project goal was to run large compute-intensive applications on clusters 
        of nodes using a simple programmatic interface. Groups of users share 
        some of their idle CPU cycles, in a virtual grid. Once this group is in 
        place, any of the users in the group could use that cluster to run any 
        application. This framework's strength is that it does not rely on the 
        availability of any peer. Any of the peers in the framework can die, and 
        the framework will still run. This 100% availability feature is achieved 
        through role interchange of the peers running in the framework. Data is 
        redundantly replicated over several peers and peers can mutate from one 
        role to another.</p>
      <p>Jerome found that the JXTA protocols would facilitate the development 
        of JNGI because of its discovery and messaging mechanisms. <a href="http://www.jxta.org/bios/neel.html">Neel</a>, 
        one of the co-owner of the JNGI project, wrote a JXTA Abstraction Layer 
        (JAL, part of <a href="http://ezel.jxta.org">EZEL</a>) implementing most 
        of the methods needed for JNGI. Together, Neel and Jerome improved JAL 
        over time to make it a pretty robust interface. JAL is now being used 
        by other JXTA projects. The JNGI project was presented at Super Computing 
        2002, Grid Computing 2002, High-Performance Computing Consortium 2002, 
        JavaOne 2003 and several JXTA Town Hall meetings.</p>
      <p>Looking back at the JNGI project, Jerome is pleased that he selected 
        JXTA for this project. It was difficult using the very early versions 
        of JXTA. But as JXTA grew, bugs decreased and overall performance improved 
        making it a much stronger technology for development. </p>
      <p>When not developing software, Jerome likes to design and build wood furniture. 
        He rides a race bicycle in the mountains, although not since his son Junipero 
        was born last year. He also likes to travel to Italy in the winter, when 
        it's quiet and peaceful.</p>
