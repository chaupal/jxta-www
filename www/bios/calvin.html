        <img src="/branding/images/calvin.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"> Calvin Cheng, known 
        as <a href="mailto:%20cxcheng@jxta.org">cxcheng</a> on the JXTA aliases, 
        has worked on Project JXTA for Sun Microsystems in Santa Clara since 2002. 
        He is the Project Owner of project <a href="http://jdf.jxta.org">JDF</a> 
        and works on JXTA full-time. </p>
      <p>He describes his current work as &quot;entirely with stuffy enterprise 
        server-side software development&quot;. He elaborates further &quot;On 
        the other hand, what really thrills me are emerging technologies that 
        can shape our lives. In that sense, I am a believer in decentralized computing, 
        and now that goes beyond sharing music or video.&quot;</p>
      <p> Calvin's first serious step into JXTA was project JDF where he built 
        a distributed testing framework to help people deploy and execute distributed 
        tests with one command. He remembers this as a nice learning experience 
        in understanding deployment issues as well as the nature of distributed 
        applications. He hopes JDF can become a mechanism and a template to make 
        JXTA better and faster. </p>
      <p>He hopes to see JXTA become embedded into existing operating systems 
        on servers, to desktops, to small devices - JXTA Anywhere, Anytime. And 
        then world peace after that. Calvin is also an active consumer of open-source 
        Apache Jakarta projects, and a browser of many others. </p>
      <p>Personal interests: Calvin is fascinated by all kinds of gadgets including 
        cars, and how they shape our lives. </p>
