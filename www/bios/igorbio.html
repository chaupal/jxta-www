<img src="/branding/images/igor5.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Igor Katz of Tel Aviv, Israel has been a member of the Project JXTA
community since June 2001. Igor is the Chief Technology Officer at
<a href="http://www.vistaportal.com">VistaPortal Software</a> and is active in
several Open Source technology user groups.  He spends approximately 30
hours a week developing VistaPoint, an integrated Web-based reporting
and services environment that incorporates JXTA technology to enable a
virtual data repository for peer-to-peer collaboration and secure file
sharing. </p>
<P>
Igor sees peer-to-peer technology, especially JXTA as a base for the
emerging generation of Internet applications.  These new applications
will enable peers (clients in the traditional Client/Server paradigm)
to be active in the process of computing.  It means that a variety of
peer devices including desktops, servers, networks, cell phones and
PDAs will share their resources with each other.  Igor believes that by
accepting that every device be a peer, he envisions a world where
rather than using P2P as the terminology, we would use E2E
(everything-to-everything).

discuss mailing list.
