      <P> <a href="mailto:yoshinaga@akane.waseda.jp">Hirokazu Yoshinaga</a> from 
        Japan, is the Project Owner of JXCube. This project is a fully distributed 
        collaborative application that supports group based communication, plug-ins 
        tools or mediation service for synchronization, consistency, etc. 
      <P>Hirokazu is known as &quot;yoshinaga&quot; on the JXTA discussion lists. 
        He has been part of the JXTA Community since June 2001, working on JXTA 
        Technology about 40% of his time. When he first started working with P2P 
        technologies, he looked at Gnutella and Microsoft Windows XP P2P while 
        first exploring Project JXTA. He found that Gnutella does not have good 
        discovery scalability. Security at protocol level is an even bigger issue. 
        On the other hand, Microsoft Windows XP P2P is IPv6 Internet Connection 
        Firewall SDK, which not supported on most user environments. It also still 
        contains many of the issues originally reported in IPv4. He found that 
        JXTA, with its Overlay functions, offers more flexible functions than 
        IPv6. After deliberating on the options, he ultimately selected JXTA Technology 
        as his P2P strategy. 
      <p>Hirokazu says JXTA technology fits in the current Internet environment 
        that a lot of nodes exist in heterogeneous environment. That is, a variety 
        of devices in different networks are able to communicate each other using 
        JXTA overlay functions. He believes that this will lead to company-to-company 
        or person-to-person interactions.</p>
      <p>He differentiates JXTA technology from other P2P protocols not only because 
        it is a client-based technology, but also because it is possible to integrate 
        into server-based systems such as J2EE applications. Specifically, it 
        will enable to extend the server systems easily due to the inherent scalability. 
        And also, it will enable to construct fault tolerance systems simply by 
        the flexibility in JXTA's discovery mechanisms. Hirokazu expects that 
        P2P technology will become the new paradigm of networking. He also expects 
        that JXTA Technologies will a focal point of this field.</p>
      <p>He was previously an engineer in a software company. He is currently 
        at the Graduate School of Information, Production, and Systems at <a href="http://waseda.fadimo.ne.jp/index_e.html">Waseda 
        University</a>. He is also a writer for <a href="http://www.cmagazine.jp">C 
        Magazine</a>, a Japanese journal for programmers. He has written a series 
        of articles about P2P programing using JXTA. His primary areas of interest 
        are P2P networking, Overlay networking, and Thinking networks. </p>
