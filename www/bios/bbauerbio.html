<P>
 William (Bill) R. Bauer is currently adding a request-response
 capability to <a href="http://jxta-wire.jxta.org>the JXTA-Wire</a>
 project. The request(e.g. for a file) is broadcast on the wire, hence
 is pushed to every peer in the group. Responses are made point-to-point
 via a pipe advertised in the request. As a development convenience,
 he's using a BeanShell interpreter to dynamically reload classes in a
 running JXTA network.
<P>
 Bill lurks on couple of Open Source projects, including <a
 href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a>. Outside of Open Source
 projects, he is involved professionally with developers of medical
 imaging and analysis software. Between his two consulting jobs,
 co-authoring a book on medical imaging, and raising a family, his
 curiosity helps him find time to work on Project JXTA. He says that
 Project JXTA looks like a good experiment and it's worth pursuing
 because you never know where it may lead.

 Project JXTA <a href=mailto:discuss@jxta.org>discuss</a> mailing list.
