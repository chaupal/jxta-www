      <p> Nathan Neitzke started working with JXTA technology around June
2002, and currently resides in Daytona Beach, FL.  He is enrolled at Embry
Riddle Aeronautical University working towards obtaining two masters degrees,
one in Aerospace Engineering and the other in Software Engineering.  </p>
      <p> Dedicating 50% of his development time to Project JXTA (about 40
hours per week), Nathan is the Project Lead for the .NET Implementation of
JXTA Project. He believes the .NET Implementation will only allow JXTA to
further embed itself as the premier peer to peer platform for developers.
 After the initial platform release, he intends to also work extensively
on creating services that allow JXTA to become a viable enterprise technology
meeting the design goals of availability, manageability,performance, reliability,
scalability, and securability. He also serves as a platform committer and
often contributes ideas/suggestions to the developer newsgroups.       </p>
      <p> Nathan believes JXTA is an extremely exciting technology for several
reasons, but most importantly it is based on an open protocol.  Its advantages
include XML support, logical separation of the network into groups, discovery
over firewalls, and an open architecture that allows easy modification by
end users.  His vision for JXTA, which is shared throughout the community,
is that of a completely new platform for computing.  It will stand as the
base of future network based applications.  Next generation technologies
such as grid computing, user managed resource allocation, Web services, and
many more could all be built on top of the JXTA network layer allowing for
an extremely dynamic and extensible computing environment.       </p>
      <p> The other main software project he devotes his time to is "Eagle
Eye", a project by Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, to launch a satellite
into space that will capture images of the earth's surface.  The team is
developing the software that will capture the images on the satellite, compress
them, send them over http down to earth to a PERL script running on Red Hat
Linux, which then stores the images in a MYSQL database. </p>
