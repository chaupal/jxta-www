 <P>
 Raffi Krikorian spends about 20 hours a week as a Committer on the RRS,
 Shell, Platform projects and a Contributor on the Security project. He
 works for <a href="http://www.clip2.com">Clip2</a> where he had been
 involved in the development of a load testing application to stress
 test the JXTA platform. Clip2 has also developed the remote rendezvous
 service whereby which rendezvous operators can simply deploy peers
 around the network and manage them all remotely and via the JXTA
 technology.
 
 <P>
 Aside from this, Raffi has also made some miscellaneous patches to the
 Platform and the Shell projects. His future plans include designing
 and implementing the <a href="http://rrs.jxta.org/secure-rrs.html">secure rrs</a> 
 and adding support for advertisement expiry into the core.  
 Raffi has also written the <a 
 href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2001/04/25/jxta.html">"hello jxta!" 
 tutorial</a> for O'Reilly --
  the first published  <a 
 href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/p2pweb2001/view/e_sess/1791"> 
 tutorial</a> on how to build a JXTA technology application.   
  At JavaOne, he was a participant on the JXTA community BoF panel at JavaOne, 
 and also covered both nights of JXTA BoFs for O'Reilly -- take a look
  at the articles he wrote at:
 <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/06/11/ligong.html">http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/06/11/ligong.html</a> and 
 <a 
 href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/06/11bofs.html">http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/06/11bofs.html</a>.  
 He will also be delivering the Project JXTA tutorial with <a 
 href="mailto:juan.soto@sun.com">Juan Carlos Soto</a>, Project 
 JXTA's Community Manager, at the O'Reilly P2P Conference this September.
 
 <P>
  Raffi envisions Project JXTA to be a middleware layer for many
  different P2P systems each talking to each other via the JXTA
  protocols. He believes JXTA will have to borrow heavily from other
  currently existing technologies in order to succeed following an
  "embrace, and extend" philosophy. (In order to be successful, he
  thinks that the JXTA technology will have to mate properly with other
  P2P systems and possibly act as a bridge between different systems.)
 Raffi says that the main strength for the JXTA technology may lie in
 the wireless P2P community -- at its core JXTA technology is designed
 for unreliable and asynchronous communications, both of which occur
 readily in the wireless systems.
