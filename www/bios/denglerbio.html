<P>
 Tom Dengler currently spends about 30 hours a week specifically with
 Project JXTA and about 45-60 hours total, researching distributed
 computations, network theory, and learning the Java technology.  He
 says that the inclusion of the JXTA source code is a major benefit in
 his Java learning curve.
 
 <P>Tom is an owner on the Spec Project and has contributor status on the
 JXTA-Wire Project. He is active on the IRC channel and frequently
 comments on the discuss@jxta.org mailing list. Tom also has an interest
 in the Distributed Shared Memory Project, as he thinks it will be a
 powerful tool in creating distributed computation machines.
 
 <P>Tom is currently on a semi-retirement sabbatical from jobs where he
 modeled financial projections using very computationally heavy
 applications. He now devotes his time to researching distributed
 algorithm theory and ways to enable the Internet as a mass computing
 machine. His hope is that Project JXTA will be an enabling technology
 for this sort of thing.
 
 <P>Tom's first Open Source contribution was to the Open Projects Network
 IRC server conversion, where he was motivated to investigate the
 problems of the chaotic p2p platform as reflected in an IRC
 environment. He finds the Project JXTA level of cooperation and quality
 of applications to be astounding and a major benefit given his
 non-corporate environment. With the great community growth of Project
 JXTA, Tom thinks that the JXTA technology will eventually be very
 widespread.

 mailing list <a href=mailto:discuss@jxta.org>discuss@jxta.org</a>.
