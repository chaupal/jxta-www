<img src="/branding/images/radu.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Radu Muresan dedicates approximately 60% of his time to Project JXTA.
He's interested in the platform and security projects.
In addition to attending Master's courses at UBB University in
Cluj-Napoca, Radu is currently working on integrating some security
related items using the JXTA technology in his job as a Java software
developer at <a
href="http://www.ags.ro">Alfa Global Solutions (AGS) Cluj-Napoca</a>.
Other JXTA specific issues which are of interest at his job are linked
to the communication part of the technology. </p>
<P>
Radu thinks that the idea that drives JXTA is very powerful, yet JXTA
has still a long way to go before it will truly become a standard.
There is also work to be done regading the docs, which are severely
outdated and optimizing the platform source code.  From a developer's
point of view, JXTA may be unfamiliar at the beginning, but using the
mailing lists one can easily find the answer to (almost) any question.
He says the market needs peer2peer solutions, and this would be JXTA's
chance.
<P>
You can reach Radu on the Project JXTA discuss mailing list or at
radu@ags.ro.
