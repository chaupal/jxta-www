      <p>Elizabeth (Betsy) A. Nichols or &quot;ean&quot;, by her jxta.org username, 
        has been a member of the JXTA Community since December 2003. She is CTO 
        of Sequation, Inc. a company pioneering security metrics management. She 
        is located in Vienna, Virginia. She currently spends approximately 10% 
        of her time working with JXTA technology. She has been participating in 
        the development of JXTA technology by sharing the findings of Sequation 
        developers with the JXTA community, while developing a complex distributed 
        security management application. </p>
      <p>When Sequation were first designing the SOS application and researching 
        appropriate technologies to use, they considered using Globus. They decided 
        to use JXTA technology because of the simplicity of design and based their 
        design on the Java-based implementation. Betsy cites benefits to her development 
        team as: </p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li><i>We do not have to implement the functionality ourselves</i></li>
          <li><i>We are part of a larger community that is both testing and deploying 
            in large environments as well as improving the technology</i></li>
          <li><i>We expect the protocols will become a broadly accepted standard</i></li>
          <li><i>JXTA can support peers written in languages other than Java</i></li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>Betsy has a personal vision for how peer-to-peer and grid technologies 
        can be used to support the functionality required for IT security and 
        risk management. Specifically, she believes that any measurement and control 
        of risk must result from the fusion of information across multiple, heterogeneous 
        sources. These sources must know about assets, their configuration, their 
        current operational state, their vulnerabilities, countermeasures or defenses, 
        and finally threats -- potential or future. For this reason, risk management 
        is a process that requires collaboration and cooperation of multiple &quot;specialists&quot; 
        -- software based and human, embodied as services in a service oriented 
        architecture. These services must operate as peers to derive a risk state 
        and then take appropriate action to protect and/or defend. The best architecture 
        for this is a peer-to-peer grid of cooperating services -- in stark contrast 
        with the manager-agent hierarchies that were embraced by earlier 20th 
        Century systems management technologies.</p>
      <p>She continues that the peer-to-peer architecture is not enough. There 
        is an additional requirement for distributed service workflow orchestration 
        and an associated application development environment to facilitate creation 
        of security and risk management solutions on an enterprise wide scale. 
        This is the value that Sequation has layered on top of JXTA. <a href="http://www.sequation.com/solutions/index.php">SOS 
        Release 2.4</a> is currently shipping.</p>
      <p>Betsy is a founding member of the Java Management Extension (JMX) expert 
        group within the JCP. Sequation is a strong believer in opensource philosophy. 
        They develop using opensource software from a number of different organizations.</p>
