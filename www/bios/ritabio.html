Dr. Rita Yu Chen became a member of the Project JXTA community in April, 2001. 
She is a committer on the security project, a contributor of the platform 
project, and the co-author of white paper <a 
href="http://www.jxta.org/project/www/docs/trust.pdf ">"Poblano - A Distributed 
Trust Model for Peer-to-Peer Networks"</a>.
<P>
Rita has spent her spare time in the open source community since she
began working on the <a href="http://www.gnuspace.com">GnuSpace</a>
project. There she found her interests in decentralized computing,
trust management systems, and adaptive routing. After Project JXTA
launched, her discussion on reputational search at discuss@jxta.org
drew Bill Yeager's attention. Their joint white paper on "Poblano"
followed shortly afterwards.  She continues to work on the Project JXTA
security project, and helped Bill to plug Transport Layer Security and
a Public Key Infrastructure into JXTA. In the future she plans to
continue working with Bill on exploring and further refining the ideas
addressed in "Poblano" by the means of a JXTA implementation.

Rita's full-time career at Sun is on timing analysis for UltraSPARCIII family 
microprocessors. Her research topic also includes power consumption estimation 
and performance optimization for chips. Besides research, Rita loves outdoor 
activities, eclectic music, reading about natural science, and writing travel 
essays during quiet moments.
