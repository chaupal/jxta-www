      <img src="/branding/images/skpark.bmp" align="LEFT">      <P> SeungKi Park has been a member of the JXTA Community since October 2001. 
        He is known on the mailing lists as <i><b>skpark</b></i>. He works for 
        <a href="http://www.peercom.co.kr/english/">Peercom</a> in Seoul, Korea. 
        He spends about half of his time working on JXTA Technologies. He is the 
        JXTA-C project task leader for the TCPTransportTask. Although he has used 
        a great deal of Open Source Software in the past, this is the first time 
        he has taken an active role in a project. 
      <p></p>
      When he was first began working with P2P technologies, he looked into established 
      technologies such as Gnutella. He also looked at Groove Networks which he 
      found to be language and platform specific, as well as application-specific 
      (eg. File sharing). He felt JXTA to be much broader in scope with well-defined 
      protocols covering the breadth of the P2P space. By using JXTA technology, 
      developers do not need to deal at the protocol level, allowing them to focus 
      on their specific task at hand. 
      <p>Looking towards the future, SeungKi thinks JXTA technology will grow 
        and become even easier to use. He thinks it will become the defacto standard 
        of P2P, and even the platform of choice for ubiquitous computing in the 
        future! On a personal level, he is planning on using JXTA technologies 
        on various embedded devices and ad-hoc network protocols such as IrDA, 
        BlueTooth. He has strong interests in these areas. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p> In his free time, SeungKi enjoys playing classic guitar, singing a song, 
        reading, theatre, and swimming and mountain climbing. </p>
