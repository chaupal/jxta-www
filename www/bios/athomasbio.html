Athomas Goldberg of New York is the President and CTO of Improv
Technologies, Inc. and Chief Architect of Improv's Cirquet Platform,
a component-based framework for developing, deploying and managing
large-scale distributed applications based on JXTA. He has been a
member of the Project JXTA community since April 2001 and dedicates
45-55% of his time to Project JXTA.
<P>
Athomas is the Project Owner for many projects on jxta.org:
<a href="http://jaas-membership.jxta.org">jaas-membership</a>, 
<a href="http://jnlploader.jxta.org">jnlp-loader</a>, <a href="http://lrmp-endpoint.jxta.org">
lrmp-endpoint</a>, and <a href="http://validation-agent.jxta.org">validation-agent</a>.
In addition, he's a committer on the platform, soap and gameplatform
modules. His principal contributions to Project JXTA have been in
trying to provide enterprise-level services on top of the core platform,
as well as trying to ensure that the platform itself meets the needs of
enterprise scale applications. In addition, Athomas is active in the
Jini developer community as well as various groups devoted to
intelligent
agent development.
<P>
Athomas sees the P2P network embodied by Project JXTA to be the next
real
evolutionary step for the Internet and the Web.  He says that the
client-server model
that dominates the Internet can never match the flexibility and
scalability
an architecture like JXTA's provides.  As JXTA matures he believes that
we will
begin to see the distributed applications deployed on a global-scale,
connecting everything from the largest super-computers to the smallest
hand-held devices and appliances.  

<P>
Athomas doesn't think the challenge for JXTA is finding the killer-app,
because he thinks the world is full of distributed applications
inefficiently deployed on out-dated centralized architectures. When you
compare the cost and effort of deploying and maintaining applications in a
traditional manner versus a peer-to-peer approach like JXTA, the benefits
are obvious. He says that the real challenge for JXTA will be in making
these applications easily accessible to the average user in the same way
that J2EE made client-server applications easily accessible to anyone with a
computer, an internet connection and a web browser.
