Shinji Kobayashi is a doctorate student at <a href="http://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/english.new/eng/index.html">Kyushu University</a> in Fukuoka, Japan. You may know him as "skoba" on the Project JXTA aliases. He is the project leader and a developer on the Medical Grid Alliance Network (MeGA-Net) project. The IPA (Information technology promotion agency in Japan) is supporting MeGA-Net with a grant under the MITO FY2003 Exploratory Software Project. The Japan Medical Association assists with technical support. It is an open source software project to create a peer-to-peer (P2P) information base on healthcare. With this project, medical institutes, hospitals, care units, pharmacies can share clinical patient record seamlessly.
<P>
Typically medical information is stored in a client-server network model. In this model, a central hospital has the sever, and the satelite clinic must have client software. The problem is that many central hospitals do not have this technical relationship with some satelite clinics or other hospitals. The MeGA-Net project aims to construct a medical information grid that will have a interrelationship among medical institutes on demand. 
<P>
Project JXTA technology is used to make these relationships to share medical information via P2P. These organizations chose JXTA technology because they could easily redistribute the application to many hospitals and clinics on the open source license.
<P>
The project is now under development and will be finished March 2004.
<p>
Shinji is a very new member of the Project JXTA community. He sees JXTA and P2P as the "real" Internet. His goal is to make common knowledgebase using JXTA technology. He also participates in <a href="http://www.bsdbbq.org/">regional BSD user groups</a>, known as BBQ.
