<img src="/branding/images/bruno" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Bruno Margerin of The Washington DC area works
for Sciences Systems Applications, Inc. as a contractor for NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center. He is developing a prototype of Peer-to-Peer Satellite Data Distribution
System. He thinks that it is a more functional, cost effective and efficient
way of science data distribution that conventional centralized client-server
systems. </p>
<p>The first sets of JXTA based tools are designed for <a href="http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Landsat
7</a> data sharing. These Landsat 7 scenes use a unique distribution license
in which a fee is charged per ordered scene. Once delivered to you, the
scene can be redistributed freely.
<p>Bruno first started on the Gnutella protocol in his free time customizing
a JAVA implementation of Gnutella called furi (from William W Wang) in
Fall 2000; thus the name Satella (SATellite + GnuTELLA). He became a member
of the jxta.org community in early May and developed a Prototype called
"Satella Prototype Phase I" in September 2001. Phase I is a JXTA-based
proof of concept and derivated from Instant P2P.
<p>Phase II is under development and is a service based prototype providing
the basic of semantic search of Landsat 7 data. Phase II will provide a
Web based GUI, for administration, configuration and use. It has been designed
to be turned into web services easily later on. Satella Phase II is expected
to be distributed to the Landsat community for testing and evaluation on
May 2002.
<p>Bruno spends 80% of its time on the Satella project resulting in about
40% of its time on JTXA development. He has contributed to the <a href="http://www.jxta.org/jxtaprogguide_final.pdf">Project
JXTA: Java[tm] Programmers Guide</a> by providing the Creating a Secure
Peer Group section and contributes to the implementation of metadata support into
the
<a href="http://cms.jxta.org/">CMS project</a>.
