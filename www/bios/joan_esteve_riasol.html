      <p> Joan Esteve Riasol was born in Barcelona, Spain in 1981. He began programming 
        when he started started his studies on Technical Computing Engineering, 
        in the Computing Faculty of Barcelona. In 2003, he published his first 
        complete application developed with Java (An applet-based Local Search 
        resolver using XML. To continue his university studies, he moved into 
        High Computing Engineering (in the same Faculty) where his Master's thesis 
        is on JXTA technology. </p>
      <p>The Project Juxta-Cat (his master thesis) is a new open source project in the 
        JXTA community at java.net. You can find the project at <a href="https://juxtacat.dev.java.net/%20">https://juxtacat.dev.java.net/ 
        </a>This project allows P2P remote computing and is already available 
        for download. </p>
<p>

Joan also likes to enjoy things beyond the computer, mountain biking, travel, and going out with friends and my family. He says:&quot;I think that everyone needs to distinguish work 
from free-time, because both things are necessary to be happy during his life.&quot; </p>
