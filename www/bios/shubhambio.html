Shubham Tyagi of Buffalo, NY has been a member of the JXTA Community since
September 2001. He is an Undergraduate Student in Computer Engineering at 
SUNY Buffalo. In the Fall of 2002 he will be a Graduate Student in 
Computer Science at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.
Shubham's areas of interest is Distributed Systems.
<P>
Shubham is the project owner of jxAuction and dedicates approximately
30-50 hours a week to Project JXTA. Over the last few months he has been 
working on a commercial auction application that uses the JXTA backbone 
for all communication. His goal is to setup a free and reliable peer-to-peer 
auction network free from moderators.  
<P>
Shubham thinks that JXTA is going to play a major role in the development of
future Distributed Systems and Peer to Peer applications. The fact that it
uses XML for communication and is compatible with multiple protocols
like tcp, http, etc. gives developers a great convenience. Once all the
stability and security issues have been resolved, Shubham sees the 
internet almost free of servers and dependent on peer-to-peer applications 
that allow users to share resources and do infinite other things.

You can reach Shubham at tyagi@buffalo.edu or on the Project JXTA discuss
mailing list.
