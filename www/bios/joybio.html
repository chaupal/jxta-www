      <P>The Red Herring wrote of Bill Joy, "If the Red Herring had the job of 
      starting the computer industry all over again and we could pick five 
      players living today to pull it off, Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy 
      would be on that team."</P>
      <P>Bill received a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of 
      Michigan and a MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from 
      U.C.Berkeley, where he was the principal designer of Berkeley UNIX (BSD). 
      The Berkeley version of UNIX became the standard in education and 
      research, garnering development support from DARPA, and was notable for 
      introducing virtual memory and internet- working using TCP/IP to UNIX. BSD 
      was widely distributed in source form so that others could learn from it 
      and improve it; this style of software distribution has now led to the 
      "open source" movement, of which BSD is now recognized to be one of the 
      earliest examples.</P>
      <P>For his work on Berkeley UNIX, Bill received the ACM Grace Murray 
      Hopper Award which is given for outstanding work in Computer Science done 
      when the recipient is under the age of thirty. In 1993, Joy was given the 
      Lifetime Achievement Award of the USENIX Association, "For profound 
      intellectual achievement and unparalleled services to the UNIX community." 
      Bill joined Sun from Berkeley in 1982, and has led Sun's technical 
      strategy, spearheading its open systems philosophy. In the mid 1980's he 
      designed Sun's Network File System(NFS), and was a co-designer of the 
      SPARC microprocessor architecture. In the 1990's Joy "left the urgent 
      behind to get to the important," to create and head up Aspen Smallworks, a 
      small Sun R&amp;D lab in Colorado.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990's he did the basic pipeline design of UltraSparc-I 
      and its multimedia processing features. This basic pipeline is the one 
      used in all of Sun's SPARC microprocessors shipping today. In the mid 
      1990's Bill lead the initial business and technical strategy for Sun's 
      Java programming language and platform, and co-authored the book "The Java 
      Language Specification" which precisely described it. Wired magazine 
      described Java as "the most important development in computing since the 
      explosion of the Internet."</P>
      <P>In the late 1990's Bill and the Smallworks staff started the Jini 
      project, a revolutionary interconnection technology for networking 
      computer devices, for which they developed the Sun Community Source 
      Licensing (SCSL) model, which adds to the traditional open source model a 
      intellectual property framework designed to guarantee the compatibility 
      that is needed in a highly networked world.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Joy was appointed by President Clinton as Co-Chairman of the 
      Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC). The 
      Advisory Committee is providing guidance and advice on all areas of 
      high-performance computing, communications and information technologies to 
      accelerate development andnadoption of information technologies that will 
      be vital for American prosperity in the twenty-first century. The report 
      of the committee is available at http://www.hpcc.gov/ac.</P>
      <P>Bill was appointed as Chief Scientist of Sun in 1998. His current main 
      activities are research into simple reliable and secure distributed 
      systems, public policy in science and information technology, and helping 
      set the strategic technology direction for Sun as a member of the 
      Executive Committee.</P>
      <P>Bill is the co-recipient, with Andy Bechtolsheim (also a co-founder of 
      Sun and now a VP at Cisco systems) of the Computerworld Smithsonian award 
      for Innovation in 1999. Bill has been inducted to the 1999 Computer Museum 
      Industry Hall of Fame and received the PC Magazine 1999 Lifetime 
      Achievement Award. Bill is a member of the National Academy of Engineering 
      and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</P>
      <P>As part of his public policy role as Chief Scientist, Bill has been 
      investigating the nature of the emerging 21st century sciences and 
      technologies. His cover article in the April, 2000 issue of Wired 
      Magazine, entitled "Why the Future Doesn't Need Us" has ignited a 
      worldwide discussion of some dangers from and ethical issues in the 
      development of these technologies.</P>
      <P>Bill enjoys skiing, hiking and theatre, and is an avid reader. He is a 
      member of the Board of Directors of the Novell 
  Corporation.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
