      <P><a href="mailto:robin@syndicom.com">Robin Johnson</a> is known as rmjohnson 
        within the JXTA Community. He lives in Durango, Colorado and has been 
        working with JXTA technologies since June 2001. He is involved in several 
        different JXTA Community Projects. He is a Committer on <a href="http://allhands.jxta.org/">Allhands</a> 
        project, a Committer on <a href="http://cms.jxta.org/">CMS</a> project, 
        and the Owner of <a href="http://juxtaprose.jxta.org/">JuxtaProse</a> 
        project. 
      <p>He currently dedicates spends about 20% of his work time working with 
        JXTA technology. He is currently working for Syndicom, Inc. which is developing 
        a case tracking system for spine surgeons called SpineConnect. They had 
        started the <a href="http://allhands.jxta.org/">Allhands</a> project with 
        the goal of creating a generalized case-tracking platform which could 
        be customized to build more specialized applications, like SpineConnect. 
        Prior to becoming involved with Syndicom, he had started the <a href="http://juxtaprose.jxta.org/">JuxtaProse</a> 
        project, which is the discussion application on which Allhands is based. 
      </p>
      <p>When Robin was first designing the system that would become project 
        JuxtaProse, he considered using Gnutella technology. Once he discovered 
        JXTA technology, he was totally hooked. He felt that JXTA appears to be 
        the most (if not the only) open extensible platform for general peer-to-peer 
        networking. He found the Gnutella protocol is far less versatile when 
        it comes to offering additional services beyond filesharing and simple 
        searching. He hopes to see JXTA become a rich set of building blocks for 
        quickly creating a custom peer-to-peer system as easily as one would create 
        a centralized system.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Since the HTML interface of Allhands is built using <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/Tapestry/">Jakarta 
        Tapestry</a>, Robin has been involved in the Tapestry community in addition 
        to his activities within the JXTA Community. When he is away from his 
        computer, he enjoys mountain biking, trail running, hiking, skiing and 
        snowboarding.</p>
