Neelakanth Nadgir, known as neel on the jxta.org aliases, started working on Project JXTA in early 2001 and is currently the owner of two projects: <a href="http://jngi.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JNGI</a> and <a href="http://ezel.jxta.org/jal.html">JAL</a>. He originally started with the JXTA project while using JXTA on a distributed computing project. JXTA is the natural fit for performing distributed computing over the Internet. The JAL (JXTA abstraction project) aims to simplify JXTA development. It is in active development, and several JXTA projects have benefited by it.

<a href="http://www.jxta.org/JavaOne/JavaOne2003/jngi.pdf">JavaONE</a>, SunNetwork conference, GRID 2002, and the HPC (High Performance Computing) Consortium. He evangalizes Project JXTA technology to a lot of people he meets at these conferences. He also contributes articles to the Solaris Developer Connection.
