Nelson Minar is one of the Project Owners of the core platform, as well
as a general contributer to design and usage of JXTA. He has
contributed a <a href="http://www.clip2.com/jxta_chat.html"> tutorial 
application</a> for developers, a 'second example app' after a 
Hello World type application. He has also provided commentary on the design
of the platform, gotten 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">log4j</a> into the implementation, and has helped set up
the IRC channel #jxta on <a 
href="http://www.openprojects.net">irc.openprojects.net</a>.

Nelson has been a lead on three major open source packages:
<li><a href="http://www.hivecell.net/"> Hive</a>, a peer-to-peer mobile agent 
platform
    
<li><a href="http://www.swarm.org/Swarm">Swarm</a>, a toolkit for building 
agent based models
    
<li> <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/hhm-beta/"> html-helper-mode</a>, a 
popular emacs package for editing HTML
<P>  
He is a firm believer in the strengths of Open Source, having
worked with GNU products for the last 11 years, Linux for the last 7.
Nelson thinks that Infrastructure should be free and Open Source means freedom.
