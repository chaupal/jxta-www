<P>
Jean-Christophe Hugly, otherwise known as J-C, is one of the initial
"Project JXTA" developers from Sun. Most of J-C's work so far has been
with the peerGroup, the bootstrap, and their relationship with
configuration and applications. J-C's professional life before Project
JXTA was spent dealing with operating systems, specifically ChorusOS, a
distributed real-time OS.  He joined Sun as a result of the Chorus
Systems aquisition in 1997.
<P>
To J-C, the most exciting thing to make of the JXTA technology is a
self organizing and self healing computing substrate; a neutral primal
soup that offers just enough constraints to enable a multitude of
higher-level organizations to form, cohabitate, and compete for
adoption.

discuss@jxta.org mailing list.
