<P>
Darren Govoni has been a member of the Project JXTA community since May
2001. He is the Project Owner of the 'jxtabeans' project where he hopes
to inspire the development of a full JavaBean compliant component model
atop the JXTA platform. With this, users and developers can quickly
'snap' together P2P beans and configure and deploy JXTA peers and
services using cool visual tools.
<P>
In addition, Darren is collaborating with a group of authors on a
forthcoming book on JXTA due out this spring. Professionally, he
engages in speaking opportunities on the subject of web services, P2P
networks and adaptive computing and writes for various publications on
these matters. Darren sees JXTA as a vital, open technology that will
enable the proliferation of value driven, self-emerging communities
spawned by variety of innovative peer applications.
