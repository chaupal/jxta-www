<img src="/branding/images/radha.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Radha Shreeniwas is a Programmer Analyst at the Innovation Labs in <a
href="http://www.reuters.com">Reuters</a>.  Also a member of the Linux
community, she is an early adopter of the JXTA infrastructure.  Radha
is using the JXTA technology to create proofs of concept, drive
innovation, and promote awareness amongst engineers and product
managers of Reuters, in order to innovate their thinking around the
products that target the financial markets. </p>
<P>
Radha is active in discussions with the JXTA community and dedicates
all of her time to Project JXTA. She has created some proofs of concept
around meta - searching and is now trying to develop JXTA for use
specifically with financial scenarios (exchange of data, subscription
to data and publishing of data).
<P>
Radha thinks that the JXTA model is very well thought out and that
there are tremendous application possibilities in the area of financial
data distribution and exchange. She says that it needs to become more
stable as a technology and address important security issues without
which it's widespread deployment might falter. However, she sees the
JXTA model being adopted in dealing with several key areas of concern
in the information delivery business - effective distribution,
analytics based on the information and information exchange.

You can reach Radha at radha.shreeniwas@reuters.com or on the Project
JXTA discuss mailing list.
