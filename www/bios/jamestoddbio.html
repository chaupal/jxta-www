      <p>  James Todd, known as gonzo on the jxta.org aliases, is a Sun Microsystems
employee based in Santa Clara, California. His role has predominately been
to apply JXTA features with complimentary enterprise deployment capabilities
like that of JNDI/LDAP, WebStart/JNLP, etc... He also considers himself the
general rebel rouser. He is the owner of the myjxta2 and rosettaChat projects.
He'd like to merge/coopt rosettaChat into myjxta2 as a service/feature.  </p>
      <p>  James sees JXTA as the developer enabler to leverage resilient
features, like those found in DNS and SendMail, directly within the application
domain to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>uplift application features</li>
 <li>provide pervasive deployments</li>
 <li>increase ease of use. </li>
      </ul>
 Further he believes, JXTA is a principal means by which Internet/intranet
based applications can escape the (limiting) four walls of the browser on
devices large and small.  
      <p>   He has also helped roll out the initial release of Tomcat/Ant/WatchDog.
James is a happy user of JDOM/Jaxen/Drools, Tomcat, Ant, and FreeTTS.  </p>
