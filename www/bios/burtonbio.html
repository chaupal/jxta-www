Kevin Burton has been a member of the Project JXTA community
from the start (April 25, 2001). He spends approximately 10-20% of his
time on Project JXTA and is a committer on both the shell and platform
projects. Kevin has fixed a number of issues in the shell and platform
Java bindings. He's also built the <a href="http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge

">JXTA SOAP Bridge</a>.

Kevin Burton is a long-standing contributor within the Apache
Software Foundation (ASF) and has concentrated on Open Source,
distributed systems, Java, XML, object oriented design, performance analysis,
scalability design, and security engineering.  He has created a number
of Open Source projects including, <a
href="http://reptile.openprivacy.org">Reptile</a>, <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jetspeed">Apache Jetspeed</a>,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/alexandria">Apache Alexandria</a> and
also co-founded the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine">Apache
Turbine</a> project. All have
been very successful, with Jetspeed attracting involvement from
companies such
as IBM, SAP, and NEC and Turbine now driving
some of the most complex applications on the Internet. He is also
involved
in next generation Software Engineering, and is trying to use the
distributed, evolutionary Open Source model to build quality, stable,
and scalable software.
<P>
Recently Kevin has been busy working on the OpenPrivacy project. After
being
co-founded in late 2000, the project has released its first Open Source
project, <a href="http://reptile.openprivacy.org/">Reptile</a>. He is
currently trying to
build a secure, distributed, reputation and identity system which
includes neurological routing and
optimization.  All of this will be based on JXTA and centered around the
Reptile project.
