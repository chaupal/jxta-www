<P>
Chris Genly really enjoys spending his free time on Project JXTA. He is
a committer on the platform and shell projects. He wants to increase
his understanding of the JXTA technology and help move the code
forward. Chris has been working on an improved message proposal with bondolo
and others.
<P> 
Chris was a Senior Software Architect working on distributed 
systems at ShareThis.  Unfortunately, ShareThis closed its 
doors in May due to lack of funding.  Project JXTA is Chris' first 
open source project. He likes the result of a good group mind. Chris 
wants to see JXTA become a widely adopted protocol set for building P2P
apps.
