<img src="/branding/images/jimclark.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Jim Clark is the owner of the <a href="http://jxtaview.jxta.org">JxtaView 
Discovery Demo project</a> and a committer on the shell, myJXTA, and 
RossettaChat projects. He dedicates approximately 30% of his time to Project
JXTA. </p>
<P>
According to Jim, the JxtaView Demo project is mostly his "fault".  It
demonstrates the JXTA discovery process by allowing the user to
manually launch discovery, and then showing the results in a graphical
tree display of groups and peers.  The JxtaView Demo download also
includes a demo of RosettaChat running within myJXTA.  It's available
from the JxtaView homepage: <a href="http://jxtaview.jxta.org">http://jxtaview.jxta.org</a>
<P>
Jim is currently working on a picture sharing demo. PicShare is a JXTA
application that broadcasts pictures to fellow peergroup members. Each
peer displays a picture frame. When you drop an image file into the
frame, it is sent to all the other peers in the group that are running
PicShare, and will appear in their picture frames.  More information
and screen shots from a UI prototype are available at
<a href="http://nightware.home.mindspring.com/picshare/picshare.html">http://nightware.home.mindspring.com/picshare/picshare.html</a>
<P>
Jim would like to see JXTA become the industry standard development
platform for peer-to-peer applications.  He says that the ultimate goal
would be for JXTA to become so simple, stable, and easy to use that it
becomes an almost taken-for-granted part of the development process,
the way a good user interface library is now.
<P>
Jim is an independent contract programmer, of the Jack-of-All-Trades
variety.  He's available for contract work on JXTA or other projects.
You can reach him on the Project JXTA discuss mailing list or at
nightware@mindspring.com
