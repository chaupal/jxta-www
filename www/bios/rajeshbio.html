<img src="/branding/images/rajesh.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Rajesh H. Acharya is associated with Project JXTA in a unique way. He started as a contributor for <a
href="http://instantp2p.jxta.org">InstantP2P</a> while working for his previous employer on JXTA technologies.
<p>
With his increasing interest in JXTA and peer-to-peer computing, he initiated the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jxtabang/">JXTA Special Interested group at Bangalore</a> to promote the technology for wider adoption and research. He ventured into setting up <a href="http://www.zudha.com">Zudha</a>, a self funded company, promoted by a global exports group, to nurture a team of JXTA developers to work on promising products and services.
<p>
 

Rajesh hopes that JXTA peer networks will truly Juxtapose alongside the client server networks in the coming years. He thinks that while JXTA has emerged as leader in file sharing P2P with several applications available now, it will emerge as leader in P2P market if it addresses process sharing (not just file sharing) in an effective way to endorse Sun's vision of "The Network is the Computer".
<p>
 

His vision is to set up a JXTA/Peer-to-Peer Computing competency center at Bangalore to provide extensive support to develop JXTA-C and JXTA-Embedded RTOS platforms while providing application development expertise in Peer-To-Peer computing.
