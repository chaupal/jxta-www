Kevin Jett, known as kjett on the Project JXTA aliases, works at BBN Technologies in Arlington, VA USA. He started working with Project JXTA in December 2001 and is a Contributor to the JXTA Platform. He answers posted questions on the JXTA mailing lists and submits bug reports on the platform. He spends about half of his time working with Project JXTA technology. 
<p>
He is currently the lead developer on a project using the JXTA Platform to develop a toolkit for building systems of distributed software agents.  These agents can process data autonomously to produce hypotheses about various topics, but they have the added ability to share their hypotheses with one another in an intelligent P2P manner in order to hone in on the most accurate solution to the problem.  His current field of interest is in distributed sensor systems, specifically using the JXTA peer abstraction to treat a group of incongruous sensors as equal members of a data-sharing community.  He and two of his colleagues presented this technology at the 2003 JavaOne conference in San Francisco, and again at the Project JXTA Town Hall Meeting that same week.
<p>
The biggest draw for Kevin in using JXTA has been the ability to seamlessly integrate many different data sources, without regard to their internal structure, by treating them all as “peers” on the network.  He thinks this is a powerful advantage as we move from a world of plugged-in, desktop-based computing world to the dynamic, wireless, mobile world emerging today.  
<p>
Kevin received a B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Virginia in 1999, with a minor in Computer Science.  His major was entirely liberal-arts in nature, and it remains a subject about which he is still very much interested.  He speaks Spanish and Portuguese and is in the process of learning Russian.
