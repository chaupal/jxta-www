      <P> 
        Michel Polet, know as <a href="mailto:mpol@jxta.org">mpol</a> in the JXTA Community, is located at Eschweiler near Aachen (Germany) and Brussels. 
      <P>He is currently spending half of his free time working with JXTA Technology, about 20 hours a week. He has recently launched project <a href="http://jxdbc.jxta.org/">JXDBC</a>, a proxy  driver for JXTA.
      <P>He first joined the JXTA Community in February 2003 after a brief period of experimentation with <a href="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">Freenet</a> project. He once gave a presentation on JXTA technology. The group planned to go to the theatre after the presentation. They never made it to the theatre! 
      <p>        In 2000, Michel was a consultant programmer during the restructuring of a major Belgian bank. A competing firm wanted to develop a furniture managing system in Ms-Access that required a permanent access to the bank internal network. 
      The main analyst did not like this approach. He interviewed several people, including Michel, who provided him with enough information to demonstrate the danger of such an approach. Unfortunately  within the constraints of their environment, there didn't seem to be a reasonable, cheap and light solution. Neither consulting firm got the job. When he discovered JXTA two years later, he remembered this quandary. After playing a year with the JXTA Shell, he imagined a solution based on JDBC and JXTA. His biggest concern was to build a reliable communication path using an unreliable network technology by design. He is currently testing this implementation to  validate his idea.</p>
      <p>Michel found that         JXTA is an unusual tool for a programmer. It helps to solve network-related problems for which there was previously no solution available and it triggers the imagination to develop application of a new kind.</p>
      <p>He does think that         JXTA should be integrated at the operating system level (as a service for Windows or a daemon for Unix). It should be written in C or C++ (the operating system language) for compactness, with a nice Java layer on top of it. He does admit to a bias since Java is his programming language of choice! :-) </p>
      <p><strong>Personal information</strong><br>
        Michel became a father at 45 for the first time and for the second time at 50. 
      Lola (8) and Leah (3) have replaced  previous hobbies which included sailing and motorcycling. Current life is more domestic in focus. The family feeds the cats, the guinea pig and the rabbit together. He also enjoys watching Lola at her horse riding lessons.</p>
