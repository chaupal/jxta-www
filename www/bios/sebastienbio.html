<B>Sebastien Baehni</B>
<P>
While working on his PhD in communication systems to add to his Master
of Computer Science degree, Sebastien Baehni spends approximately 30
hours per week on Project JXTA.  He is a contributor on the platform
and the jxta-wire modules.
<P>
Seb has developed a small chat application (inspired by the hotwire
service) in order to create a tutorial upon the <a
href="http://jxta-wire.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">jxta-wire</a>
service.  He is also developing a typed-based publish-subscribe
application (and API) to see what JXTA can offer for such a paradigm.
This application is using JXTA and the new genericity package <a
href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/adding_generics/">generic
java</a> in order to be more efficient.
<P>
Seb thinks that P2P applications are the future of the Internet and
that trying to create a framework for developing such applications is a
great thing. He says that Project JXTA is very interesting to him
from these two points of view:
<P>
Project point of view:
<ol>
<li type="1"> Open Source: Contributors can say what they think as well as indentify
bugs.

<li type="1"> Good Environment (web site, mailing lists, etc.): It's easy to find the
source, binaries, etc. in order to try JXTA. </ol>

Specification point of view:
<ol>
<li type="1"> Using XML:  It's a very good idea. XML is the best (for now) language we
can use in order for electronic devices to communicate with each other.

<li type="1"> Using different protocol of communication (tcp, http, multicast): This
allows us to find more peers and send information more efficiently.</ol>
