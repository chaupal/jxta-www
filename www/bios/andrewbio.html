      <p>  Andrew Fitzpatrick is in his final year of study at the <a
 href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/">University of Wales, Aberystwyth</a>.
He first read about JXTA in February 2002,and started writing a file sharing
application for use on a college network with a friend. He saw how useful
JXTA was and decided to use it for his final year project at the University.
  </p>
      <p>  His goal is to create a peer-to-peer concurrent version control
system, rather than based on the client server topology. In doing this he
hopes to improve the resiliance of current version control systems. He is
also looking at ways to improve the intelligence of such systems so that
less developer time is needed to resolve conflicts, etc... Andrew is working
to implement a system that is more useful for agile development methodologies
(XP etc) as current version control software does not suit these methodologies
so well.  </p>
      <p>   Andrew is also writing a framework to allow agent type systems
to be easily set up using JXTA as the communication links. Still in a very
rough state, he'd like to release the framework he's developing to the open
source community.  </p>
      <p>  Andrew sees peer-to-peer as THE information sharing network. He
believes that access to information "on-demand" will be the next killer application
and that JXTA is capable of providing the pipework for the programs that
will give us the information. Client-server topologies have been useful in
the past, but we will eventually become a plug-and-play society. People won't
want to log into servers (not so often anyway), be affected if the ISP goes
down or worry about how long chicken stays fresh in the fridge. JXTA, and
more articularly JXTA applications, can provide users with a means to plug
and go straight away, enable connection to the net/email at anytime and allow
 fridges to find that optimum storage time for chicken by polling a number
of other fridges on the JXTA network.  </p>
