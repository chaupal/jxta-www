Germán Toro del Valle of Madrid, Spain has been a member
of the Project JXTA community since it began in April 2001.
He is active on the discuss mailing list and files bugs on some of
the JXTA projects, mainly the <a
href="http://platform.jxta.org">Plaform</a> project.
<P>
Germán is working for <a href="http://www.tid.es">Telefónica I+D</a> as
a R+D Engineer
testing and investigating new technologies, amongst which
he is mostly dedicated to JXTA. He is looking at new
applications of JXTA in fields where P2P has not been traditionaly used.
<P>
In addition, Germán is working on his doctorate as a Telecommunication
Engineer
at the <a href="http://www.upm.es">Universidad Politécnica de Madrid
(UPM)</a>.
He is currently writing his thesis, in which JXTA will play a main role.
<P>
Germán thinks JXTA is an extremely powerful technology
although says that every technology needs some time to
mature to be established as a general use technology (as did
Servlets, EJBs, etc.)
<P>
You can reach Germán at germantoro@iespana.es or on the Project JXTA discuss 
mailing list.
