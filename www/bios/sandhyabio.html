<img src="/branding/images/sandhya2.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Sandhya Ashok of Bangalore, India, has been a member of the JXTA community since August 2001.
She currently performs the role of contributor for the
Voice over P2P (<a href="http://vop2p.jxta.org">VoP2P</a>) project. </p>
<P>
She first learned about JXTA while searching for an apt technology to
develop a P2P solution for the 'legal professionals' community on
behalf of a client.  The initial curiosity turned into deep interest
and now she spends around 50% of her time on JXTA and related
technologies.
<P>
Sandhya also contributed as one of the technical reviewers for Sing
Li's book "Early Adopter - JXTA" and has learned a lot in the process.
She works with a startup software venture named <a href="http://www.unitss.com">Universal IT
SolutionS</a> and is looking forward to riding the JXTA wave to growth.
<P>
Sandhya believes that technologies like JXTA and
WebServices are natural culmination of man's inherent liking for
communication and exchange without middle men (Servers, Websites etc.).
She is confident that JXTA is a technology to watch and it would
revolutionize the way corporations and individuals interact, in the
near future.
