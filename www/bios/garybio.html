Gary Orser of Bozeman, Montana has been a member of the JXTA Community
since September 2001.  He is a Senior Systems and Software Engineer for
the <a href="http://cns.montana.edu/research/neurosys/">Center for Computational Biology</a> in the 
Cell Biology and Neuroscience
Department at Montana State University.  He is currently a contributor
to the platform and jxta-wire projects, and spends 10-20 hours per week
working on the JXTA project.  He has extensive experience using many open
source projects at the University since 1996, coupled with extensive unix
experience since 1987.  The JXTA project is his first experience 
contributing to an open source project.
<P>
Gary is currently working on a distributed peer-to-peer application to
allow research scientists to collaborate with each other, using a self
mediated database to describe, query and share extensive meta-data about
experimental data and the experimental setup of their scientific research.
This project, when it reaches alpha status, will be an open source
project. It is leveraging several open source projects, including both
JXTA and Xindice.
<P>
Gary believes that peer-to-peer applications will be, in time, the driving
force to enable scientists to more effectively collaborate, drive adoption
of standards, and allow scientists to "do better Science".

You can reach Gary at orser@cns.montana.edu or on the Project JXTA discuss
mailing list.
