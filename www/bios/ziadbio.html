<P>
  
    Ziad El Kurjie has been involved in numerous peer-to-peer open
    protocols including Gnutella and OpenNap, and now Project JXTA.  He
    is the head of engineering at Clip2, where he has driven
    formulation and execution of the Clip2 contribution to Project
    JXTA. He dedicates about 40 hours a week to Project JXTA.</P>

    <P>Since early April, Ziad and Clip2 have turned their attention to
    the network that JXTA peers will run on; its topology, dynamics,
    and performance implications.  By understanding those attributes of
    the JXTA network, they were able to write code to crawl the
    network, graph its topology and monitor its components.  
    Recently, Clip2 started reporting some of that data on the <a href="http://www.clip2.com">Clip2 
    web site</a>. This work led Clip2 to develop the <a
    href="http://rrs.jxta.org">Remote Rendezvous Service (RRS)</a>,
   software that facilitates management and utilization of rendezvous peers.</P>

  
    <P>According to Ziad, Project JXTA has introduced a common platform for
    the technical community to evolve in ways that make it possible to
    design and build applications in peer-to-peer models.  He's quite
    psyched to see implementations on platforms of varying architectures
    such as palm and wireless, as it opens up the scope of the solutions
    the community would introduce.  The network is quite bigger and looks
    so different, all of a sudden! </P>
  
    <P>Ziad sees peer-to-peer computing playing a role in the next wave of
    information discovery and archival applications.  Project JXTA's
    efforts should further solidify the implementation of the common
    transports, while new services can be developed to tie application
    specific architectures into the core.  His technical
    interests revolve around network management and data discovery.  
    Project JXTA stands as a ripe environment for the implementation of 
    some known techniques in the new model, while opening up the opportunity 
    for new solutions to be figured out and incorporated into commercial systems.</P>
