<img src="/branding/images/iraklis.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Iraklis Angelos Klampanos has been a member of the Project JXTA
community since November 2001. He's a contributor to the JXTA Search
Project and spends approximately 70% of his time working with the JXTA
technology.  Currently, Iraklis is working on upgrading JXTA Search to
work under the latest stable JXTA platform. He's interested in
distributed Information Retrieval in general and believes that JXTA and
JXTA Search are the best place for someone to begin experimenting and
researching new techniques. </p>
<P>
First and most importantly, Iraklis would like to see Project JXTA
remaining free to the public domain. He'd also like it to be widely
used in the future by large companies and by individuals in order they
improve on their activities. Lastly, he would like to see the project
playing a significant role in his personal research interest,
distributed and p2p information retrieval.
<P>
Iraklis will obtain his Bachelor of Science degree, with honors, in Software
Engineering this June and will start working on postgraduate degree in
Distributed Information Retrieval next year. You can reach him on the Project JXTA
discuss mailing list or at klampaia@dcs.gla.ac.uk
