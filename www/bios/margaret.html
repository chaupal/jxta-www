      <P> Margaret Green, known as mgreen on the jxta.org aliases, was introduced 
        to Project JXTA at the O'Reilly Peer to Peer Conference in 2001 where 
        Bill Joy first announced the technology. She worked with Consilient to 
        develop next generation P2P collaboration products which were demonstrated 
        in the JXTA area of the 2001 JavaOne Pavillion. 
      <p> Margaret started her own company, <a href="http://www.ontonet.com/">Ontonet</a>, 
        in San Jose, California. Ontonet is a storage management and database 
        technology company focused on managing disparate data everywhere. 
      <p>
JXTA technology is the Network Overlay for Ontonet's data storage managment. The peer model enables Otonet to offer decentralized, data storage as a service to consumers, applications, and middleware servers. A person can store data such as an image, sound, or text with the service. The service provides redundant storage across multiple peers. The storage peers join a federation. A person rendevous' with a federation peer, accesses their data from that federation representative. The federation peer transparently manages routing of store and retrieve requests to the actual physical storage peers.

<p>
Project JXTA enables Ontonet to build massively scalable data management systems. The peers manage failover and recovery, cooperatively among themselves. The rendevous peers and federation peers choose how spread the load. Yet they can also deploy as a local group of peers on the computers and devices in a home or office. Being both platform independant and language independant, JXTA enables Ontonet to build a unified storage platform. Ontonet designed JXTA Network Overlay in Spring of 2002 and is now implementing the design.

<p> 

Maragaret promotes adoption of the JXTA platform in a world of small wireless devices. She believes there will be a lot of data emiters out there and wants to be the receptor for those data emmissions. In her free time, Margaret plays guitar and studies Naginata, a Japanese martial art.
