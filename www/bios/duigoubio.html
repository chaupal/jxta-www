<img src="/branding/images/mike2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Mike Duigou has been using his Project JXTA handle 'Bondolo' since he
first joined the net community in 1984. He has a background in operating
systems, particularly filesystems and storage drivers. In 1989, Mike
quit his university studies to found an e-commerce software start-up
with two friends long before it was fashionable. </p>
<P>
Mike joined Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1998 and finds himself surprised,
but thrilled, to be paid for working on open source software. Mike's
first open source contributions were to the Citadel BBS software in
1987 and he has contributed other work regularly on a variety of
projects.
<P>
Mike is most involved with the network transport and messaging layers
of Project JXTA and the JXTA Protocol Specification effort. As well he
has been involved with the advertisements and documents, the
authentication model and the IDs. He is currently working on the <a href="http://jxta-c.jxta.org">JXTA-C</a>
implementation project.
<P>
Mike is a regular on the #jxta IRC channel on irc.freenode.org. You
can also reach Mike at bondolo@jxta.org or on the Project JXTA discuss
mailing list.
