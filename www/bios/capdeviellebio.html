<B>Scott Capdevielle</B><P>

Scott is CEO of Syndicom, a developer of services to enable better
collaboration in the field of Medicine. He dedicates 10-15 hours per
week to Project JXTA and is currently managing the creation of user
stories and GUI's for the JXTA allhands project. He is also working with
Nitin Borwankar and Adrian Blakey experimenting using nntp servers as
containers for advertisements (see <a
href="nntp://news.syndicom.com">nntp://news.syndicom.com/jxt.advt.*</a>.
)
<P>
Scott has worked with open source since 1994, beginning with Linux, then
NCSA's http server and Postgres in 1995.  He began his experience with
open source software development integrating Postgres into Andromedia's
first product, Aria. Recently scott has been a student of the technical,
economic and sociological underpinnings of the open source movement.  
<P>
His goal is to use the allhands project to 1. leverage as much existing
jxta code as possible to create the application, 2. Integrate XP
programming practices into open source development, 3. Bring
non-technical end users into the collaborative efforts of open source
development.
<P>
Scott's vision for Project JXTA is that it has the potential to be the
leading, open source platform for peer-to-peer collaboration.  You can
reach him at scott@syndicom.com or on the discuss@jxta.org mailing list.
