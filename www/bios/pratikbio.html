      <P> Pratik Dhebri of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is a Master’s student at Carnegie 
        Mellon University’s Information Networking Institute (INI). He has been 
        a member of the Project JXTA community since January 2002 and dedicates 
        10-20 hours per week to JXTA. Pratik is a project owner of <a href="http://angelopeerrendezvous.jxta.org/">Angelo’s 
        Peer Rendezvous</a>; an enterprise based instant communicator which he 
        developed at INI with the help of his peers using JXTA technology. He 
        is also a contributor on the jxta.org P2P-email and security projects. 
      <P> In addition to his work with JXTA technology, he is also the creator 
        of Prasec (Pratik’s Security), a dynamic, totally distributed peer-to-peer 
        based Public key Infrastructure. He hopes that other people will exploit 
        the functionality of this platform and develop many applications using 
        this architecture, avoiding the high costs associated with a central Certification 
        Authority. Pratik is also active in the Bouncy Castle developer community 
        and is helping the community by implementing Transport Layer Security 
        in the Bouncy Castle Java Cryptographic Extension. 
      <P>
Pratik envisions peer-to-peer networking to be the next revolution in computer networks after the Internet. He thinks that an efficient, common platform like JXTA will facilitate rapid development of such applications and also help achieve interoperability between various peer-to-peer applications. He foresees a world where every device will be connected.
