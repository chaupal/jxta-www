      <p> <a href="mailto:Satoshi.Hasunuma@jp.yokogawa.com">Satoshi Hasunuma</a>, 
        also known as "hasunuma" on the JXTA mailing lists, is the Project Owner 
        of <a href="http://jxta-monitor.jxta.org">jxta-monitor</a>. He launched 
        this project on 21 June 2004. He is also a Contributor to the <a href="http://platform.jxta.org">platform 
        project</a>. He spends about 20% of his time working with JXTA technology. 
        He is located in Nakacho.Musashinoshi, Tokyo, Japan. </p>

      <p>When he first started developing P2P applications, he came right to JXTA 
        technology. He was attracted because it allowed him to focus on developing 
        his application since JXTA takes care of the P2P needs. Peer groups allowed 
        him to easily create a virtual overlay network. Pipes allowed for simple 
        communication between peers. He also feels that JXTA's language independence 
        is an additional strength of the technology. Since JXTA technology is 
        not completely dependent on a specific development language, developers 
        have a choice of using Java or other languages. JXTA technology can be 
        used on personal computers but embedded machines and various sensors can 
        use JXTA advertisements to communicate. This scalability and platform 
        diversity is another advantage of using JXTA technology. </p>
   
      <p>The jxta-monitor tool was inspired by Yuuichi Sakuraba who is a coworker 
        and also a developer at Yokogawa Electric Corporation. Sakuraba's support 
        enabled Hasunuma to develop the tool and the project space. Hasunuma works 
        at the Ubiquitous Field Computing Research Center at <a href="http://www.yokogawa.com">Yokogawa 
        Electric Corporation</a>.</p>
      <p>When Hasunuma and Sakuraba were developing a P2P application, they realized 
        how important it was to verify that the JXTA advertisement published correctly. 
        They developed the JXTA-monitor tool to perform this check. They created 
        this as a debugging tool for identifying and resolving advertisement problems. 
        It visualizes the messages by capturing the various JXTA advertisements 
        available on the network. JXTA-monitor allows a developer to watch changes 
        to the network when new clients, such as a new embedded device, is added 
        to the network. This enables rapid identification of issues that may arrive 
        with addition of the client's design or configuration. Hasunuma and Sakuraba 
        decided to offer the tool to JXTA community. They hope the tool will be 
        widely adopted for debugging activities by Open Source developers.</p>
      <p> When he is not developing software, he spends as much time as possible 
        participating in outdoor sports including mountain climbing, fishing and 
        watching stars etc.</p>
