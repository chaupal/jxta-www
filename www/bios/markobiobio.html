<P>
Marko Srdanovic works for <a href="http://www.improv-tech.com/">Improv
Technologies, Inc.</a> as a Lead Software Engineer.  He is currently
spending 10-20% of his time on Project JXTA and expects that to
increase over time.  He has been evaluating and reviewing projects on
jxta.org as well as submitting feedback, minor bug fixes, and some
Makefile modifications to support building under Cygwin.
<P>
At Improv Technologies, Marko and others are currently working on a
component development system designed to facilitate the creation,
deployment, and maintenance of cross-platform and cross-device
networked and distributed applications. They are using Project JXTA as
their platform neutral inter-peer message and data transport layer.  Improv
is currently in the alpha test phase of their Cirquet<sup><font
size="-2">TM</font></sup></font> product with a number of their software
partners.
Marko says that they hope to create a project on <a href="http://www.jxta.org">
jxta.org</a> based on the work currently being done at Improv.
<P>
Coming from a background in large-scale distributed simulation, Marko
would like to see JXTA technology become the one of the "standard"
mechanisms to have heterogeneous devices share information and digital
services on the network.  He hopes that Project JXTA, along with the
current security and monitoring projects can truly enable peer-to-peer
information and digital service exchange to occur in a robust,
consistent, traceable and secure manner.
<P>
Marko is anxiously awaiting some real-world JXTA based applications and
projects beyond the current file sharing and search ones we see now.
He wants to see more "real-time" (or at least near real-time)
distributed applications that use the JXTA technology.  He feels that
new types of distributed applications, or at least those that make
better use of network resources, are just beginning to appear on the
horizon and that we are just about to enter a new era of distributed
computing.  Marko hopes that JXTA technology helps make this a
reality.
