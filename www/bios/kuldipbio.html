<P>Kuldip Singh Pabla is a Project JXTA Engineering Manager at <a
href="http://www.sun.com/jxta">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a>  He focuses
all of his time on Project JXTA, as he is the project owner of the
JXME, CMS, InstantP2P, Spec & Monitoring projects.</P>

<P>Initial discussions of Project JXTA concepts and protocols led Kuldip
to initiate the CMS, InstantP2P and monitoring Projects.  Kuldip recently initiated the JXME project to implement JXTA technology on small devices.  Meanwhile, he's been getting involved with the Project JXTA community and encouraging it's members to participate and make Project JXTA successful.</P>

<P>Kuldip thinks that Project JXTA is an excellent concept to provide
building blocks for P2P solutions. Although it's still is in it's
infancy, he envisions the Project JXTA community driving the technology
toward becoming the "solution" for enterprises in the future.</P>
