<P>
Jeff Schneider, architectural contributor to the Platform Project, has
been dedicating 25 hours per week to Project JXTA since it went live on
April 25, 2001. He has been prioritizing tasks, documenting
architecture and doing some performance engineering on the core.  He
looks forward to the day when JXTA technology becomes the primary
vehicle for peer-based communication - when going to the JXTAnet is as
common as using a browser.</P>

<P>Jeff, a resident of Austin, Texas, was the author of the first
Enterprise Java book and one of the original writers for the Java
Developers Journal.  He is also the founder of Momentum Software, the
premier Java consultancy in Texas and is now the founder of <a href="http://www.resilientedge.com"> Resilient
Edge</a>, maker of the first Enterprise Peer Platform being rolled out on
JXTA technology.</P>

<P>You can find Jeff on the Project JXTA discussion mailing list
