 align="left" height="80" hspace="10"> Edward Ribeiro is a second year
MSc. student at University of Brasilia (Brazil), and also a software
developer in a brazilian government institution. He has been interested
in JXTA since its creation, but started to work on it in the beginning
of 2005. In his research, he is building a distributed infrastructure
to launch and control computational biology programs as BLAST, for
example, among three universities. This infrastructure is based on JXTA
because it is the most mature p2p model available and offer good
flexibility. He has been spending at least 20 hours a week working on
JXTA. This project has allowed him to get in touch with the JXTA
community to report bugs and discuss the platform. His most recent
contribution to the community was the updating of the wikipedia
information about JXTA. In his free time, he likes to read, watch
movies, and play with his four year old son, Bruno. </p>
