     <a href="mailto:sayed.hashimi@gmail.com">Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi</a>, known as
     &quot;sayedh&quot; on discussion mailing lists is located in Jacksonville, Florida. He joined the JXTA Community on January 20, 2005, and currently devotes 50% of his work efforts to development using JXTA Technology. He currently is a contributor to the Commons project specifically on messaging and peer presence. He is also contributing to our community as a member of the newly formed JXTA Usability Committee.
     <P>When first exploring P2P technologies, Sayed found many other technologies available,  but none compared to JXTA. He chose JXTA because of the boundaries that it breaks through, and the standards that it has created. Sayed feels like P2P computing has needed a standard cross platform/language independent protocol in order for it to make large strides against the typical client-server systems in place today. In order for large scale systems to be created they have to be interoperable with other similar systems, and JXTA provides this. Large P2P projects need a foundation that has been created with scalability &amp; interoperability in mind from its conception, this is why Sayed chose JXTA.
     <p>Since then he has found that by choosing JXTA technology, developers get the peace of mind knowing that JXTA has been created by an intelligent group of people, who know what the needs of software are going to be in tomorrows world. They have the benefit of knowing that the protocol that they are using will be supported in the years to come.
     </p>
     <p>        Sayed feels like JXTA technology will pave the way for developers to easily create P2P applications rapidly and without the dedicated resources of typical client-server architectures. Because of this common developers will be able to create distributed systems. New types of distributed applications will begin to rise to the surface once developers are able to easily and effectively use JXTA.
     </p>
     <p>        Sayed's technical interests span a wide range of software development, they include: Novel P2P applications, testing distributed systems, computer graphics, virtual humans, end-user assisted programming, human-computer interaction, and 3D Surface parameterization. He is no stranger to the land of Open Source, being the owner of the <a href="http://des.dev.java.net">des</a> project, a CSS relationship management system to generate styles dependent upon other styles.
