Alexander Carôt of Lübeck, Germany
 has been a member of the
 Project JXTA Community since October 2001. He
is  an international
 student of <a href="http://www.fh-luebeck.de/et/igi/index.html">IT &
 Design</a> at <a href="http://www.fh-luebeck.de/english/home.html">FH Lübeck</a>,
Germany / <a href="http://www.danmarks-designskole.dk">Danmarks-Designskole</a>, 
(Copenhagen) and now resides in San Francisco, California.
<P>
 Alexander is the
 Project Owner of the HALU project and a Contributer to the myJXTA
 and vop2p projects. Besides Alexander's technical studies, he's an
active musican. His studies are called IT & Design to integrate
 the arts & IT. His main idea is to have a continental (and later an
 intercontinental) live music jam session with JXTA as the p2p core.
 Alexander is also interested in highly developed user-friendly GUIs
 for p2p systems of any kind.
 <P>
 Alexander is currently working on his internship at
<a href="http://www.sparkworld.com">Spark Soundstudio</a> in
 Emeryville, CA, where he is gaining valuable experience in
 audio-engineering, sounddesign, and videoediting, These things
 are combined with his own musical activities as a bass player in
 Jazz (upright bass), Rock, and Funkmusic (electric bass guitar).
<P> 
 All of these things go hand in hand with the
 <a href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/soundwire/">
 SoundWIRE project at CCRMA</a> (Stanford University)
 and the<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/nmp/index.html">
 NMP</a> project at the University of California, Berkeley, which both
 focus on having musicians play live "together" without being physically
 located in the same place. Alexander thinks that JXTA could be one of
 the leading p2p technologies because it offers all of the important
 features of future network architecture.
 <P>
 You can reach Alexander at Jazzalex@ccrma.stanford.edu
or on the Project JXTA discuss mailing list.
