Sean Kelly of Santa Clara, CA is an independent consultant. He has been a member of the
Project JXTA community since May 2001. He is the Project Owner of
<a href="http://tini.jxta.org">TINI</a> and a Committer on the Platform,
Shell, and JXME projects. Sean's vision for Project JXTA is simple:
interoperating in everything, everywhere.
<P>
In addition to software contributions to the JXTA platform, Sean
provided
the first TINI running JXTA in the Project JXTA area of the exhibit
pavilion
at JavaOne 2002.  Bill Joy's vision that any device with a "digital
heartbeat"
can become a JXTA peer is demonstrated by the TINI running JXTA: small
enough to fit in a lightswitch, it can be the digital heartbeat for any
appliance
or device.
<P>
Outside of his work with his clients and on Project JXTA, Sean is the
Project Owner of the XML Resume project, and XML/XSL system enabling
people to format resumes and curriculae vitae in PDF, HTML, and plain
text
formats, all from a single XML source.  Read more about it at
<a href="http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/">
http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/</a> He's also the Project Owner of
<a href="http://tiniant.sourceforge.net/">TiniAnt</a>, an extension to
the Ant build system for building applications on the TINI.
