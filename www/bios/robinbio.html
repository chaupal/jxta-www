<img src="/branding/images/robin.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Robin Johnson is the owner of the <a href="http://juxtaprose.jxta.org">JuxtaProse project</a> and a committer on
the CMS project. Approximately 60% of Robin's free time is dedicated to
Project JXTA, mainly to JuxtaProse. It's a discussion application where
all conversation and moderation is accomplished by sharing files using
the content management system. While being a discussion application
right now, it has the potential to become the P2P equivalent of the web
browser by incorporating JXTA URLs into the messages and allowing
pluggable URL handlers. </p>
<P>
It seems obvious to Robin that a JXTA browser should be
discussion-based because commenting on existing content and publishing
new content is every bit as fundamental to the peer-to-peer paradigm as
"consuming" content.  Along with other projects, JuxtaProse requires
advertisements with more metadata fields than are currently provided by
CMS.  This has led Robin to work towards improving the extensibility
and interoperability of the metadata in CMS.
<P>
Robin says that after sadly watching the world wide web become
increasingly subject to corporate and government control, JXTA is a
very tempting fresh start.  JXTA promises to be as versatile as the
web, but decentralized enough to utilize the computing resources of the
hundreds of millions of home computers connected to the Internet.
Since the JXTA network would be powered largely by home users, they
would have much more say in deciding the way the network is run,
hopefully bringing back the notion of the Internet being a place where
individual freedoms can thrive.
<P>
Robin recently graduated from a technical training program at the University 
of Minnesota and is currently looking for a UNIX system administration 
job. You can reach Robin on the Project JXTA discuss mailing list or at
robin_j25@yahoo.com.
