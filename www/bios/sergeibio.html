<P>Serguei Osokine, otherwise known as Oso, is located in San Jose,
California.  For the last year, he's worked on the GnutellaNG project
(later gPulp) and on the <a href="http://www.vadem.com/development/gnutella">  Gnutella Development Forum</a>, designing the infinitely scalable flow control mechanisms for Gnutella. He is currently working for <a href="http://www.infolio.com">Infolio, Inc</a>

<P>Oso started on Project JXTA on April 25, 2001. He spends approximately
10% of his time on Project JXTA, attempting to merge the existing P2P
efforts (like Gnutella) with Project JXTA. Oso wants to encourage
community involvement to make sure that Project JXTA is not a
stand-alone effort by Sun. He would like to see Project JXTA fit into
the large picture and find it's proper place in the P2P landscape.

<P>Oso thinks that Project JXTA has an excellent chance of forming a set
of P2P paradigms and generally accepted XML constructs that might be
useful to the P2P community as a whole. According to Oso, Project JXTA
can define the 'language' of the P2P, if it only manages to gain the
wide acceptance in the P2P circles. He says that in order to do so,
Project JXTA has to concentrate on what it does best, defining the
P2P-specific semantical primitives and leveraging the existing concepts
(like Gnutella routing or SOAP/XML-RPC) whenever possible.
