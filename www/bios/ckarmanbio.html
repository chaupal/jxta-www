Christine Karman is the Founder of <a
href="http://www.tryllian.com">Tryllian</a>
in Amsterdam, Holland. Tryllian, which has been a member
of the Project JXTA community since May 2001, provides distributed agent
products, services and solutions. Christine is an astrophysicist by
training, is a longtime software engineer who has been working
in artificial intelligence since 1987 and mobile-agent technology
since 1993. A pioneer in artificial intelligence,  she left her
position at the Dutch software company, Origin, and founded
Tryllian in March  1998. She recently relinquished her CEO title
in spring 2001, however she remains actively involved with the
company, focusing on strategic business development and public
relations.

Christine thinks that the world has been thinking in terms of
centralized systems for decades, then everyone turned to
client-server, which provided as little flexibility as centralized
systems. She says that what we need is flexibility and adaptivity. 
Users don't want to know about architectures. Users need data, 
information, knowledge, and communications wherever they are. 
Christine sees JXTA as a step towards extremely flexible and 
adaptive architectures.

Christine says that JXTA enables Tryllian to use auto-discovery, pass
firewalls, and solve their NAT problem. They have been using JXTA since
the summer of 2001, and now are actively using the security features.
JXTA allowed them to solve infrastructural problems their very dynamic
environment poses, enabling Tryllian to focus on the core features of
their platform.
