Morgan McGuire founded Blue Axion Studios six years ago and has since
been involved with several MIT inter/intranet startups including Curl
Corporation, Valora Wireless, and Oculus Technologies Corporation.  He
has been a member of the Project JXTA community since August 2001 by
contributing to the JXTA core and working on a commercial product using
the JXTA technology.
<P>
Morgan worked with Tim Wall (<A HREF=http://www.oculustech.com>Oculus
Technologies Corporation,</A>) and Mohamed Abdelaziz (<A
HREF="http://www.sun.com">Sun</A>) on integrating JXTA with Oculus Technologies
flagship product, CO.  CO is a commercial peer-to-peer tool for
information exchange across different operating environments and tools
and has previously been featured in the JXTA company spotlight.  The CO
browser is implemented in 100% Java, and moving to JXTA was a natural
choice for peer-to-peer network discovery.  Their work led to a
simplified boot sequence for the JXTA core, which remains open source,
as well as proprietary code for Oculus.  This is a good example of a
company and an open source project interacting to the benefit and
growth of each.
<P>
Morgan says that JXTA is well positioned to be an open source,
Java-friendly platform for providing similar services to .NET for
peer-to-peer interchange and distributed computing.  He wants to see it
fulfill this potential. He thinks that the challenge for Project JXTA
is a streamlined API and set of pre-built services for easy integration
into commercial products, and addressing the wide spectrum of
applications that can leverage the peer-to-peer model. For example, at
<a href="http://www.blueaxion.com">Blue Axion Studios</a>, they are interested
in the possibility taking the JXTA technology beyond business and hobby
applications and using it to provide peer-to-peer gaming services under
both Java and C++.  Multiplayer gaming ranks with e-mail and web
browsing as one of the major consumer level network applications, and
this is the right time to develop infrastructure for it.
<P>
Morgan is the maintainer of the open source graphics3d Java & C++
graphics library, which is to be released in 2002 at <a
href="http://graphics3d.com">graphics3d.com</a> in association with
Prentice Hall. He holds Bachelor and Masters degrees from MIT and is
currently working on his doctorate in Computer Science at Brown
University. You can reach him at morgan@blueaxion.com or on the Project
JXTA discuss mailing list.
