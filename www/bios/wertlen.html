      <P> Ron Wertlen, also known as rw on jxta.org discussion threads, is married 
        and lives in Berlin, Germany. He works for <a href="http://www.neofonie.de/">neofonie 
        GmbH</a>, which was a previous <a href="http://www.jxta.org/companies/companyarchive.html#neofonie2">JXTA 
        Company Spotlight</a>. Ron happily updates the JXTA Community that <a href="http://s2s.neofonie.de/navigation/index.jsp?nav=77773">neofonie's 
        Science-To-Science project</a> described in that spotlight is now being 
        released to public science research institutions! 
      <p>Ron has been working on Project JXTA since first quarter of 2002. He 
        follows the discussion threads every day. He participates by helping out 
        wherever he can, occasionally submitting a bug patch or a detailed bug 
        report, and other times supporting other users. He hopes to get more involved 
        in developing Project JXTA. <a href="http://platform.jxta.org/java/workinprogress/rdv-hld.html">Walkers</a> 
        and autonomic topologies leave a lot of room for new ideas and implementations, 
        especially the work going on in the platform regarding <a href="http://platform.jxta.org/java/workinprogress/srdi.html">SRDI</a>. 
        He also sees developments in JXTA security quite fundamental to establishing 
        JXTA as a serious production weight network and is quite excited about 
        Jambalaya for this reason.</p>
      <p> He reads the mailing lists every day because besides notification of 
        fixes, events etc., he finds there are a lot of good ideas out there, 
        especially technical ideas. He also likes to participate virtually in 
        JXTA meetings and gives his opinion where it is constructive. He promotes 
        JXTA daily through his work at neofonie. He always participates in JXTA 
        Community votes, lending his support to the JXTA Community in the simplest 
        and yet most basic way.</p>
      <p>Ron believes that there are several benefits to using JXTA. First of 
        all, JXTA leads the standardization effort in an area where closed source, 
        proprietary protocols are the rule. Thus developing a network application 
        which speaks JXTA is a sure way to maintain interoperability with other 
        services. This allows usage scenarios which are related to Grid enterprises, 
        but which have a stronger autonomic and decentralized flavor. With Version 
        2 of JXTA, developers also get a powerful Java framework for building 
        distributed decentralized social (P2P) applications. He continues saying 
        that getting the most out of the JXTA platform does require some knowledge 
        of the complex structures and processes in the platform, but there is 
        always documentation or someone online to help out. Using JXTA is easy 
        and it's the best way to learn about the technology.</p>
      <p>He believes that custom applications which speak JXTA but use proprietary 
        technologies will emerge. These will take advantage of application specific 
        optimizations, but will also take part in the global network. A powerful 
        open source development kit based on current efforts (Ezel, JXTA Sockets, 
        etc.) will continue to allow general applications to emerge. In a way, 
        the development of Project JXTA and the social interactions in its community 
        and other communities based on open principles, show the way to a possible 
        future world: a world in which communication is open and is used to bring 
        people together, to foster understanding and to build a fair and peaceful 
        society. JXTA shows that all peers can be equal (from a protocol standpoint) 
        despite their unique capabilities.</p>
      <p>Beyond computers, he is keenly interested in current developments in 
        microbiology and genetics. Specifically symbiosis and immunology fascinate 
        him. The balance between destruction and creation, regulation and freedom, 
        in the networks within us is astounding. This science also goes to show 
        what people so often forget, that their vehicle through life - this body 
        we each possess - is a marvel.</p>
