      <P> David Savage has been a member of Project JXTA since April 2001. He's 
        the project owner of the <a href="http://go.jxta.org">GO</a> and <a href="http://JXRTL.jxta.org">JXRTL</a> 
        projects and active on the discuss@jxta.org mailing list. David is currently 
        in the process of setting up a consultancy business to provide help and 
        advice to organisations interested in using distributed computing to improve 
        their operations.
      <p>David sees Project JXTA as a useful step towards standardizing the fragmented 
        Peer-2-Peer market place. He says that the P2P architecture provides a 
        scalable solution that will massively increase the computational power 
        of services on the Internet, but which also can be used to offload work 
        from the core network infrastructure, so allowing the network to grow 
        again. Both innovation and standardization are key to this endeavor and 
        Project JXTA provides just the right mix of both. </p>
      <p>In the future he expects to see a greater use of distributed computation 
        and content distribution in commercial applications. He says that JXTA 
        will allow smaller less powerful devices to form dynamic groups with other 
        potentially totally different devices to perform complex tasks. David 
        also thinks that JXTA is well positioned to form a coherent solution to 
        this problem due to its open-source nature and backing from major players 
        in the computer industry, including Sun Microsystems and other companies 
        mentioned in the companies spotlight.</p>
      <p>David anticipates that a major challenge for Project JXTA will be in 
        providing developers with applicable tools to allow them to build robust 
        applications on top of the potentially chaotic P2P network topology.</p>
      <p>Outside of the JXTA world, David has worked as a developer and architect 
        for the telecoms, finance and consumer market sectors for four years. 
        Prior to this he was a student at Cardiff University where he studied 
        Physics and worked with his professor on his final year project to develop 
        a ground-breaking method of studying quantum-scale electrical conductivity 
        phenomena.</p>
      <p>In his spare time, David enjoys reading, listening to a wide range of 
        music, cooking (curries a speciality), socialising with friends, watching 
        movies, and programming and playing games on computers.</p>
