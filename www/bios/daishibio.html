<img src="/branding/images/daishi.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Daishi Kato is a researcher in the Computer Science department at
Stanford University. He is also the Project Owner of <a
href="http://jnushare.jxta.org">Jnushare</a> and <a
href="http://gisp.jxta.org">GISP</a>. He dedicates 10-20% of his time
to Project JXTA.  He's working on providing GISP in the JXTA service
layer so that a JXTA application can easily achieve information
(metadata) sharing in a peer-to-peer manner. GISP is based on
distributed indexing which is potentially scalable. Daishi has also
provided Jnushare, currently a file/message sharing application. </p>
<P>
Daishi hopes that JXTA will become a common platform and be present in
every computer.  His vision is that there would be many peer-to-peer
applications on JXTA connecting each other all over the Internet.
Daishi says that one could find lots of information through JXTA network and  
hopes that in the future, with GISP, it would be possible to search for any 
information without search engines.
<P>
You can reach Daishi on the Project JXTA discuss mailing list or
at daishi@axlight.com.
