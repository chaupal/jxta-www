      <P> Raymond Gao, also known as &ldquo;raygao&rdquo; within the JXTA Community is a JXTA community&rsquo;s board member and the founding editor and publisher of <a href="http://p2pjournal.com">P2P Journal</a>. Active in the JXTA community, Ray is a project leader, a commentator, and an implementer. 
      <p>Ray first learned about Project JXTA from Bill Joy&rsquo;s speech at Sun&rsquo;s <a href="http://sdc.sun.co.jp/developers/spf/sts2001/">STS </a>symposium in Denver, February 2001. Shortly afterwards, he started to develop an in-depth interest in project JXTA after attending and speaking at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne </a>conference, June 2002 at San Francisco. During that conference, he visited project JXTA booth and spoke with several companies involved with P2P technology. </p>
      <p>Ray is also the editor-in-chief for <a href="http://p2pjournal.com/">P2P Journal</a>, a peer-reviewed technical journal dedicated to the peer-to-peer and parallel computing interests. P2P Journal is quite unique, because the journal cover pages always show unique pictures, either from Ray&rsquo;s personal paintings or pictures taken during his journey to different parts of the world. It shows arts and sciences complimenting each other. For example, one issue&rsquo;s cover (<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~raygao/paintings/sydney_edited.jpg">Sydney, Day &amp; Night</a>) is an oil-painting from his trip to Sydney, Australia. And, another issue shows the beautiful domes of the <a href="http://p2pjournal.com/issues/Jan_05.png">St. Basil Cathedral</a> in Red Square Moscow.</p>
      <p>He is the project owner of the <a href="http://commons.jxta.org/">http://commons.jxta.org/</a> project, which tries to make JXTA more practical and easier to learn for new developers. The project is a set of utility libraries, building on top of the existing JXTA core platform and following the tradition of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Apache Commons</a> project. Additionally, he had started several other projects, e.g. <a href="http://JXTA-GRID.jxta.org">JXTA-GRID</a> and <a href="http://venezia-gondola.jxta.org/">Venezia-Gondola</a>  projects. </p>
      <p>Right now, Ray is a program (chief) architect for <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a>. Previously, he was an e-commerce architect for <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href="http://www.eds.com/">EDS</a>, Raytheon, and Computer Associates, where he was responsible for architecting and producing blueprints for multi-million dollars projects. He has also spoken widely at technology conferences and published a number of papers. For example, in October 2004, he presented a paper at the <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/04411/">Dagstuhl seminar</a> in Germany.</p>
      <p>Ray firmly believes that the JXTA community can grow by working with other open-source communities and providing construction blocks for enterprise-grade applications. The key to JXTA&rsquo;s success may depend on how well our community works with existing technologies and other platforms.</p>
      <p>He believes that the concept behind JXTA is sound and may provide a blueprint for the next generation Internet where virtual network overlays allow continuity with existing platforms and accommodate the exponential growth from new mobile devices connecting to Internet.</p>
      <p>He has also many friends in the JXTA Community. That is an extra bonus! </p>
      <h3> Personal interests and hobbies </h3>
