Gajenthar P T, known as gajentharpt on the jxta.org aliases, works for <a href="http://www.zudha.com">Zudha</a> in Bangalore, India. He started working on Project JXTA in November 2002 and is a contributor to <a href="http://vop2p.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">VOP2P</a> and <a href="http://ezel.jxta.org/download/index.html">EZEL</a> projects. He spends about 50% - 60% of his time on Project JXTA.
<P> 
As an application developer using the JXTA platform, Gajenthar contributes to its
widespread adoption through the applications he co-develops with his
colleagues at Zudha. He also explains Project JXTA to the local student community through <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jxtabang/">JXTA
SIG Bangalore</a> and presents <a href="http://jxme.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JXME</a> in technical meetings.
<P> 
Gajenthar believes Project JXTA has the ability to create rich applications which do not
require centralized servers. And Project JXTA addresses
the vast space of networked consumer and embedded devices, from smart
cards, pagers, and mobile phones, to set-top boxes and automobile
navigation systems to inter-operate with each other.
