<img src="/branding/images/AW72x93.JPG" ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Art Whitten is CTO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.InViewSoftware.com">InView Software(tm), Inc.</a> in Newcastle, WA. InView Software develops and markets software
products so users can better organize their daily activities, documents, and data. With InView's products, customers maintain
control of their data, whether it's distributed on desktops throughout the company or stored centrally on servers. InView Software’s
first product, Momentum(tm), is a team desktop productivity application that helps companies get products to market faster and
deliver services more efficiently. </p>
<P>
While Art looked briefly at JXTA in early 2001, he got serious about JXTA in October, 2001. Art and another developer spent about
three weeks writing a prototype and integrating JXTA into Momentum. Momentum was designed from the ground up to support P2P
deployment and had abstractions in place that allowed for a fairly easy transition from JMS to JXTA. Art and his development team
just finished implementing presence detection and security. Part of the reason Art is so excited about shipping Momentum 1.0 in
late 2002 is because it means the release of a commercial desktop application built on decentralized user management and
presence detection.

Art and his development team have defined and developed an open and flexible architecture -- developed almost entirely in Java -- for
building distributed desktop applications. This architecture is called the InView Workspace(tm), and it runs under Solaris, Linux, and
Windows. By building on JXTA's open, P2P framework, InView Software is able to focus on delivering great end-user applications.
JXTA provides the critical piece that enables Momentum users to seamlessly interact across constantly changing network
environments. 
 <P>
Art is a seasoned technical leader who has spent the better part of his career building object-oriented, graphical authoring systems
and managing and developing commercial software products. Prior to starting InView Software, Art was a Development Manager at
Visio Corporation, where he led the Advanced Development team. Prior to his work at Visio, Art was Lead Engineer for Delrina's
Echo Lake, a multimedia family album product; Technical Lead on Asymetrix Compel, a multimedia presentation graphics product;
and Software Architect on MediaShare's Hyperwire, a visual authoring tool for creating Java applets.
