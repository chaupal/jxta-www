Xi Rao of Bloomington, Indiana is a first year PhD student in <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/">Computer
Science</a> at <a href="http://www.iub.edu/">Indiana University</a>. He has been a member of the
JXTA community since May 2001 and dedicates
10-20 hours per week to Project JXTA.
He is currently working on a research project directed by Geoffrey Fox
and is responsible for integrating JXTA with a web brokering system written by
Shrideep Pallickara.
<P>
Last year Xi Rao was interested in details pertaining to JXTA
technology's Java-based
reference implementation. He read a lot of the JXTA source code
to familiarize himself with the strategies deployed in the
implementation.
This year he has been spending most of his time working on the
integration of JXTA within the <a href="http://communitygrids.iu.edu/">
Grid Computing Laboratory</a> at Indiana University's web
brokering system. The area where Xi Rao finds himself spending most of
the time during this integration process is the rendezvous layer. It will be the
infrastructure for their collaborative distance education system and the
Online Knowledge Center application. The integration of JXTA with their
web brokering system will be an open source project once it passes the
preliminary testing phase. Xi Rao has been involved in benchmarking the
JXTA system as well as the integrated system.
<P>
Xi Rao views JXTA as a good infrastructure for connecting multitude of
devices and
building distributed applications. He believes that a powerful JXTA
browser is needed for propagating  JXTA technology even further.
<P>
In his spare time, Xi Rao enjoys reading source code pertaining to open
source projects. He tries to achieve an understanding of the software
architecture underlying the implementation. He also works with several
friends
to develop a framework for making server side programming easier. The
goal of the framework under development is to handle database accesses and
EJB programming and minimize JSP programming.

discuss
mailing list.
