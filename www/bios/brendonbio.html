<P>
Brendon J. Wilson spends 40 hours a week on Project JXTA, as he is the author of
an upcoming book on JXTA from New Riders. You can read the first few
chapters of the book that have been released to the jxta.org community
at <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/projects/jxta">
www.brendonwilson.com/projects/jxta</a>. Future chapters will also be
posted to that web site. Brendon divides his time between writing the
book and contributing to the discussions on the discuss@jxta.org
mailing list. He hopes that this will not only help him get some early
feedback on the book, but it will also help the Project JXTA community
accelerate the adoption of the JXTA technology by providing another
resource to jumpstart new programmers.
<P>
In addition to his interest in Project JXTA, Brendon was the original
Lead Developer on the encrypted web-mail service, HushMail.com, which
uses a Java applet to provide end-to-end encrypted email from any web
browser. This product's source code was made available to the public to
enable a public review for security holes (see <a
href="http://www.hush.ai">www.hush.ai</a> or <a
href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/projects/hushmail">www.brendonwilson.com/projects/hushmail</a>).
<P>
Brendon's personal pet peeve is inefficiency.  He says that the
fragmented and proprietary nature of existing P2P solutions flys in the
face of what he believes is P2P core purpose: allowing people to
leverage existing resources to the maximum level possible. What's the
point of creating communication/networking technology applications if
they can't speak to each other? Gnutella, Napster, and other pioneering
P2P applications have shown us the massive untapped potential currently
locked away in devices at the edge of the Internet, but have also
erected artificial walls between their users, partially defeating the
purpose of P2P.
<P>
Brendon believes JXTA technology will take P2P to the next level,
smashing down these artifical walls to build a new economy based on
sharing resources, and therefore ideas, without restriction. The free
exchange of ideas is the founding concept of both P2P and democracy;
JXTA technology has the capability to put power back in the hands of
ordinary end users.
