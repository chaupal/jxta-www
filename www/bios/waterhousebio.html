<P>
Steve Waterhouse started working on Project JXTA after the acquisition
of Infrasearch by Sun Microsystems in March 2001. He is the 
Director of Engineering for the Sun Project JXTA group. Although he spends less
time than he would like on development, he is involved in architecture
and technical strategy for Sun's Project JXTA group. His personal interests
remain in the areas of peer to peer search and discovery as well as in 
security.
<P>
Steve's vision for Project JXTA is that it should become the dominant
mechanism for arbitrary peers to connect, communicate and interoperate
without the requirement for centralized servers. He also believes strongly
in the potential for JXTA to work with many different kinds of devices and 
services, from web services to small cell phones.
