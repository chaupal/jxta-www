   Markus Oliver Junginger started working with JXTA technology in early
2002 on behalf of his <a
 href="http://www.jxta.org/universities/UMKC.html">Master Thesis</a>, in
which he presents a Peer-to-Peer messaging system for scalable group communication. 
Although this system uses its own communication infrastructure, it incorporates 
JXTA features to look-up peers, and to find partitioned network segments. 
He is currently implementing further QoS parameters and a higher degree of 
intergration with JXTA.  
      <p>    For a German magazine on Java technology, he wrote a JXTA programming 
tutorial which is freely available online: <a
 href="http://www.javamagazin.de/itr/online_artikel/show.php3?id=326&amp;nodeid=11">article one</a> and <a href="http://www.javamagazin.de/itr/online_artikel/show.php3?id=344&nodeid=11">article two. </a>. 
 </p>
      <p>  In cooperation with Vivien Dollinger (<a
 href="http://www.yven.biz">www.yven.biz</a>), he is developing a Peer-to-Peer
collaboration tool, which will be released shortly. Vivien's web site provides further details and an early prototype. The availability will be announced at his web site <a href="http://www.junginger.biz">www.junginger.biz</a> that also offers information on other projects.<p>

Markus Oliver recently finished his Computer Science MS studies (Best Student Award) and research assistantship at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. He is also a candidate for graduation (Diplom Informatiker, FH) at the University of Applied Sciences in Augsburg, Germany. In the second half of 2003, he will be working in industry.<p>
