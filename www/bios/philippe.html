        <img src="/branding/images/pmoulin.png" align="LEFT" alt="" hspace="5">Philippe 
        Moulin is currently working on a project called <a href="http://www.net2map.org">net2map</a>. 
        He works on Project JXTA about 50% of his work time. On the mailing lists 
        he is known as moulinp1. He lives in Paris, France.</p>
      <p>Net2map is a multidimensional distributed search engine. A &quot;dimension&quot; 
        is anything that can translate a document into a value: User rating, category, 
        author, price (if the document describes an item that is for sale), etc. 
        Currently, only three simple dimensions are available: creation date, 
        size, and relevancy (provided by Lucene, when a keyword search is done). 
        More dimensions are planned to make it easy for anyone to add their own 
        dimensions to the system. </p>
      <p>Search results are displayed on a map. Each result is a small button 
        whose horizontal and vertical position matches it's dimensions values. 
        So, when you make a query on net2map, it's like looking at a particular 
        location of this &quot;map of the net&quot;.</p>
      <p>When originally evaluating technologies for n2map, Philippe selected Project 
        JXTA because there really weren't any other open-source P2P frameworks 
        available. As net2map needs to have many simultaneous users to become 
        useful, he was looking for a P2P technology that would be usable anywhere, 
        by anyone. He was specifically looking at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Open-source licensing: net2map is GPL licensed</li>
        <li>Usable on any computer, including MS Windows machines.</li>
        <li>Very easy to install and use: Opening a web-based search engine, is 
          faster and easier than installing some software. Using Java <br>
          web start, users will be able to try net2map almost as easily as they 
          use a web-based search engine. </li>
        <li>Automated software updates; net2map releases a new version almost 
          every day!.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Net2map is currently available only in French. Philippe is working on 
        translating the site to English prior to proposing the project at jxta.org.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Looking back, Philippe believes that there was an advantage to selecting 
        JXTA technology. With all that is available from Project JXTA, he did 
        not need to rewrite a new, proprietary, and incompatible-with-the-rest-of-the-world 
        P2P framework. Also, by selecting Project JXTA, he was joining a cadre 
        of software engineers who provided their knowledge and experiences when 
        he needed assistance. </p>
      <p>Looking to the future, he hopes that P2P will spread from computers to... 
        people! He explains: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;In the client-server world, client computers are inherently passive 
          and isolated from each other, and so are their users. It is like being 
          in a mostly-silent crowd, on a street: you may move, visit some shops, 
          watch street performers ... but you don't see other &quot;users&quot; 
          ... except when they are in your way. And ... wait, my comparison is 
          flawed: you can't just &quot;walk&quot; in a client-server network, 
          if something is not listed anywhere, it just don't exist.</p>
      
      <p>The P2P world may be a lot noisier, because in a P2P crowd anyone may 
        talk to anyone, but it is a lot more interesting. It just needs a very 
        advanced search facility.</p>
      <p>Mail, newspapers, and shops were there before the Internet. I believe 
        that, with technologies like project JXTA, we can build something REALLY 
        new, not just improved versions of old things.&quot;</p></blockquote>
      <p>Philippe is currently taking courses at the <a href="http://www.cnam.fr">Conservatoire 
        National des Arts de Metiers</a>, CNAM. He hopes to receive the title 
        of &quot;Computer Engineer of the CNAM&quot; within 2 years. In the meanwhile, 
        he is also looking for a job, hopefully one which would be compatible 
        with his CNAM studies. </p>
      <p>He is very active in his personal life as well. His personal interests 
        and activities include: </p>
     
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://webperso.easynet.fr/philippe_moulin/">Scuba diving</a> 
        </li>
        <li>Naginata (a martial art)</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>Making movies (with a VX2000 camcorder)</li>
        <li>Removing the dust from his synthesizers, and trying to learn to play 
          it.</li>
      </ul>
