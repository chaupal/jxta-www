      <P> Brad Neuberg started working with Project JXTA in June 2002 and works 
        full-time on Project JXTA. (Yes, the photo to the left is a bit dated.) 
        He's an independent developer in San Francisco, CA who is working on<a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org"> 
        JXTA P2P Sockets</a> and <a href="https://paperairplane.dev.java.net/">Paper 
        Airplane</a>. 
      <p> <a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JXTA P2P Sockets</a> 
        builds on the JXTA Sockets work of Daniel Brookshier and ideas from James 
        Todd at Sun Microsystems. Imagine writing servlets that receive their 
        requests and responses over the JXTA network; web servers that serve their 
        web pages over JXTA; or enterprise web services that work over JXTA and 
        can fail-over across JXTA peers. Imagine running all of these services 
        using standard open-source software such as Jetty or Tomcat. The secret 
        to achieving this lies in standard Java sockets and server sockets. 
            
      <p> Almost all network software that is built using Java depends on two 
        key classes, java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket. The JXTA P2P Sockets 
        project is creating implementations of these two classes that communicate 
        using the JXTA network rather than standard TCP/IP channels, effectively 
        'tricking' any software using them into communicating and resolving addresses 
        using JXTA instead of standard TCP/IP. The network software thinks they 
        are simply using standard sockets and resolving domain names and IP addresses 
        using TCP/IP when they are actually using JXTA primitives instead. The P2P Sockets project already includes a large
amount of software ported to use the peer-to-peer
network, including the web server Jetty, a servlet and
JSP engine, an XML-RPC client and server (library, and
more.  See the <a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org">JXTA P2P Sockets</a> web-site for the 1.0 beta 1 release.
      <p>
The other project is Paper Airplane, a plug-in for the
Mozilla browser that uses JXTA.   Paper Airplane
empowers people to easily create collaborative
communities without setting up servers or spending
money. It does this by integrating a web server into
the browser itself, including tools to create
collaborative online communities that are stored on
the machine. Web sites are stored locally on a user's
machine. A JXTA peer network is created between all of
the Paper Airplane nodes that are running. 

<p>
This peer
network does a variety of things; first, it helps to
forward requests to web servers that may be running
behind firewalls or NATs, allowing users to host and
create collaborative communities on their machines
where in the past they would not have been able to due
to network filtering. Second, the peer network creates
an alternative domain name system to the existing one,
allowing users to freely use hundreds of new domain
endings, such as .politics, .environment, .love,
.name, .crush, .marryme, .laborpolicy, .gay, and more.
 Every "web site" is actually a peer group, and domain
name resolution simply happens through peer group
advertisements.  Every Paper Airplane web site also
includes simple instant messaging and discussion
forums.  Basically its a distributed, browser based
WikiWiki system built on top of JXTA, with a very
simple, non-secure domain name system based on JXTA
advertisements.  Look for a code release in the next
few months.

<p>
Brad believes JXTA should focus very strongly on two
things: end-user usability and programmer usability. 
JXTA should attempt to auto-configure as much as
possible to 'remove' itself from the end-users view,
such as autodetecting if the user is behind a firewall
or NAT device, and present concepts to the end-user
that are already familiar such as 'web site' instead
of peer groups or 'domain name' instead of peer group
URN/Name.  For example, instead of asking the user
through a user-interface to 'Create a peer group for
communicating with others' with the peer group name
'Acme Company', it would look more like 'Create a
web-site for communicating with others' with the
domain name 'www.acme.company'.  If another user
wanted to resolve and find this peer group, they would
simply type 'www.acme.company' into the programs
Location Bar and be taken to this site/peer group. 
While this is technically less-correct it is
intuitively clearer; sometimes you have to be
technically incorrect to get a concept across
correctly.  

      <p> The second goal should be on programmer usability. Programmers need 
        usability just as much as end-users do; their 'user-interface' is the 
        API. Brad believes JXTA should disappear as an API and become more of 
        a raw transport channel, and the programming model should look and feel 
        like what programmers are used to now. The lower-level JXTA API should 
        still be available, though, for power users or for when the metaphor shown 
        to the programmer is incorrect for the task at hand. Basically the JXTA 
        API should be as simple as the JavaSpaces API is now. 
      <p>
Brad is heavily involved with <a href="http://java.mozdev.org">Mozilla </a> and <a href="http://java.mozdev.org/blackconnect">
Java/Mozilla integration</a>.

Brad is an avid tap dancer, and enjoys performance art, meditation, yoga, politics, art as life and life as
art.  He studied computer science and the humanities at Columbia University, and enjoys traveling and seeing
new things.

Brad invites you to contact him if you live in
the Bay Area and want to get a beer and chat about JXTA. You can reach Brad at bkn3@columbia.edu.
