<P>
Philippe Coupe is co-Project Owner for the payment service and has been
active on <a href=mailto:discuss@jxta.org>discuss@jxta.org</a>. He dedicates
at least 30% of his time to Project JXTA.
<P>
Philippe is the CEO of IPassport Corporation, the company that operates the
<a href="http://www.epocketcash.com/">EPocketCash</a> payment system. He
thinks that the p2p industry needs a payment system to allow the creation of
a whole new industry/market. Since 1996, he's envisioned a world where anybody can pay and get paid in
real-time without any risk or fraud, without giving any unneeded "private
information" to other parties, and by using any kind of terminal (or
software). These are the reasons he offered to make JXTA "EPocketCash Ready"
and asked to manage the "payment service project".
<P>
In the next 2 years, Philippe sees three major internet applications:
Email, Web and P2P (All these services being operated through public domain
software like SMTP and Apache).  He says that no one will want to reinvent
the wheel and JXTA will be the "P2P platform" and instead will concentrate
their efforts on the application layer. Philippe thinks that JXTA can be the
"Apache" of the P2P services - that JXTA will serve many different kinds of
applications, and not only "Internet Messenger" or "Napster-like" file
sharing.
<P>
Philippe says that JXTA can also become a networked operating system (read
his email <a href="http://www.jxta.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=9243&listName=discuss">"RE:[JXTA discuss] Global architecture proposal (and maybe
some sci-fi)"</a> dated 6/10/01). In short, he sees JXTA as a platform able
to offer internet services in a much better way than .Net (EPocketCash will
also support .Net and SOAP)
<P>
According to Philippe, JXTA, as the first P2P platform with a payment system
("EPocketCash Ready"), allows the creation of many different kind of
services served by lots of contributors and companies.  Because it will be
possible to pay and get paid through JXTA (and EPocketCash), we will see the
creation of a completely new industry offering lots of services through the
JXTA network.
