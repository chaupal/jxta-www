        <img src="/branding/images/fabrice.jpg" height=85 hspace="5" vspace="5" align="LEFT"> <a href="mailto:fdimeglio@teaser.fr">Fabrice 
        Di Meglio</a> is known as fdimeglio on the jxta.org mailing lists. He's 
        located in Paris, France. He has been working with JXTA technologies since 
        the initial launch at JavaOne 2001, and full-time 
        since June 2004. </p>
      <p>Although he doesn't have a project on <a href="http://www.jxta.org">jxta.org</a>, 
        he is an avid user of the technology. He spends a couple of hours a week 
        on <a href="http://www.jxta.org/servlets/SummarizeList?projectName=www&listName=user">user@jxta.org</a>, but he  also has his own JXTA-based project that is 
        consuming all his time. He is often found on the user mailing lists responding 
        to questions from other users. He also contributes to JXTA technology by 
        reporting development issues regarding the API and build process. He has 
        also contributed a number of feature enhancement ideas as well. He adds 
        that, although he has committer rights on the <a href="http://cms.jxta.org">CMS</a> 
        project, he hasn't had time yet to actively work on code development.</p>
      <p>When Fabrice first became interested in P2P technologies, he researched other 
        types of technologies before joining the JXTA community. Other technologies 
        he considered include: Gnutella, Freenet, Microsoft P2P SDK, Apple RDV, 
        and uPNP. He decided to pursue JXTA technology as his P2P development 
        solution because: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> clear concepts with straightforward API for an easy start</li>
        <li>nice distributed search</li>
        <li> Java-based (cross-platform) and open specification</li>
        <li>nice people and community<em> (JavaOne JXTA BOFs are great!)</em></li>
        <li>smart P2P without worrying about Firewall/NAT traversal (transport 
              protocols agnostic)</li>
        <li>inherent scalability (but he would love to see any massively deployed JXTA app)</li>
      </ul>      <p>He believes that developers gain a great deal by choosing JXTA technology:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>easy P2P framework</li>
        <li>open specification and code availability</li>
        <li>nice, robust and stable API</li>
        <li>good community support </li>
      </ul>      <p>Fabrice thinks that the JXTA community is really great. Their commitment to mailing lists and the availability of developer documentation are both instrumental to the ease with which developers can begin learning JXTA. Both give JXTA newbies  guidance making them more productive when they are getting started with JXTA concepts and APIs. Fabrice thinks that all community members can and should be contributing to these areas,  not just relying on contributions from JXTA core team.<br>
        <br>
      Fabrice is convinced that JXTA is a great P2P framework; it has matured a lot because of contributions from the JXTA community. It allows developers to build P2P applications quickly and  easily. Developers may need to think a bit differently than the traditional approach to unleash full JXTA power, but when the shift is done, everything becomes clear.</p>
      <p>Fabrice thinks also that it is time now to have a great JXTA &quot;killer application&quot; for the mass market/enterprise market that will show JXTA's real potential to the world. A natural fit with JXTA can be social networking, collaborative applications, Grid computing and online gaming worlds. Fabrice uses a great deal of Open Source Software, so he knows how it can enable great code and application development. He's never had the time to work as a committer on other projects, but is trying to find more time to become more involved with the CMS project. </p>
      <p>Currently, Fabrice is starting  <a href="http://www.proximio.com">a new company</a> focused on Online Community Management that is using JXTA in it's core. He has worked for several French startups companies in Business Intelligence, Knowledge Management and Network Security. A Java addict since JDK 1.0 Beta, he is also quite fond of distributed computing and especially JXTA technology!</p>
      <p>He also loves classical board games (Othello and Chess tournament player), having time with his son and coding fun applications. He has developed an <a href="http:///www.othbase.net">Othello Database Management</a> program  that has been announced on <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org">javadesktop.org</a>  and that will use JXTA to enable on-line tournaments playing.</p>
