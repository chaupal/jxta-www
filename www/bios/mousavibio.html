      <P> S. M. Mousavi Jahan Abadi is a software architect at <a href="http://www.digitaldream.jp/">Digital 
        Dream, Inc.</a> in Tokushima, Japan and has been a member of the Project 
        JXTA community since May 2002. He received a Ph.D. in Systems Engineering, 
        focused on distributed systems and multi-agent models for supply-chain 
        management. Currently he's working on <a href="http://www.ifreestyle.net/">Ifreestyle</a>, 
        a personal information manager and team-collaboration software product 
        based on JXTA technology. Mousavi dedicates approximately 10-20 hours 
        per week to Project JXTA as a contributor to the Platform and Bench projects. 
      <P> In his work on JXTA and Ifreestyle, Mousavi mainly concentrates on mechanisms 
        for real-time event notification, online and offline database synchronization, 
        distributed search, and detection of member presence. He has been working 
        on the Xindce native XML database too. He believes that P2P networks are 
        necessary complementary technology for server-client models, and could 
        change the future of our communication and collaboration over distributed 
        systems in the real-world. Mousavi sees JXTA as an outstanding and well-designed 
        implementation for distributed systems, providing various services for 
        different needs. He believes that future JXTA projects should provide 
        modular and tiny solutions for different needs of P2P networks, which 
        can be easily plugged into any application or device.
