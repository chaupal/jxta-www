Mathieu Jan is currently a PhD student of the <a
href="http://www.irisa.fr/paris/">PARIS Research Group</a> of IRISA
and ENS Cachan/Brittany Extension, located in Rennes, France. He
graduated from INSA Rennes as an engineer in computer science in
summer 2003. He has been working on and with <a
href="http://www.jxta.org/">JXTA</a> since February 2003. His username
on project JXTA is mathieu.

For his PhD thesis, the main research interest of Mathieu is on
convergence of grid and peer-to-peer systems, and is illustrated
through the <a href="http://juxmem.gforge.inria.fr/">JuxMem</a>
platform, which stands for Juxtaposed Memory. JuxMem is a data sharing
service for grid computing and is designed as a compromise between DSM
systems (for transparency and consistency guarantees) and P2P systems
(for scalability and high dynamicity). JuxMem offers the illusion of
an unique memory storage area across several clusters, users can
store/access data following a standard API for process memory
management. Moreover, JuxMem provides consistency guarantees for data
through various consistency models and protocols as well as fault
tolerance. JuxMem relies on the <a
href="http://www.jxta.org/">JXTA</a> P2P framework for its discovery
and communication mechanisms. Experimental evaluations and validations
on the French <a href="http://www.grid5000.org/">Grid'5000</a> testbed
via applications based on the <a
href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/%7Ediet/">DIET</a> (GridRPC system)
and <a href="http://openccm.objectweb.org/">OpenCCM</a> (Corba
Component Model implementation) <a
href="http://middleware.objectweb.org/">middleware</a> systems have
been performed. There is an
<a href="http://www.jxta.org/universities/juxmem.html">University
Spotlight</a> on the web site of JXTA about JuxMem. In this framework,
two main activities related to the JXTA platform have been
pursued. They are described in the following two paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
Testing P2P systems on real grid testbeds is a difficult task. In an
attempt to solve this problem, the <a href="http://jdf.jxta.org/">JXTA
Distributed Framework</a> (JDF) project was started. The goal of JDF
is to provide a framework allowing to easily define custom tests,
deploy all the required resources on a distributed testbed and run the
tests with various configurations of the JXTA platform. All you have
to specify is the topology of the JXTA virtual network you want to
deploy. Based on this initial work, we have developed a plug-in for
<a href="http://adage.gforge.inria.fr/">ADAGE</a>, a prototype
middleware designed to automatically launch distributed or parallel
applications on the resources of a computational grid.
</p>
<p>
Efficiently taking into account the topology of a grid and its
available underlying networks is also a difficult task. Based on work
with David A. Noblet, from the University of New Hampshire, Mathieu
benchmarked the performance of the main communication layers of JXTA
(endpoint service, pipe service and JXTA sockets) over various
networks, especially those available on grid infrastructures. Results
for JXTA-J2SE can be found on the web site of <a
href="http://jdf.jxta.org/">JDF</a> and how to use the set of
benchmarks <a
href="http://jdf.jxta.org/juxtest/howtouse.html">here</a>. For the <a
href="http://jxta-c.jxta.org/">C</a> binding of JXTA, the benchmark
code is directly integrated in the CVS of project JXTA-C. Two papers
have been published thanks to this work: one in an international
workshop (<a href="http://www.lri.fr/~fci/GP2PC-04">GP2PC'2004</a>, <a
href="http://www.irisa.fr/paris/bibadmin/show.php?id=111">link to the
paper</a>) and one in an international conference (<a
href="http://www.hpcc05.unina2.it/">HPCC'2005</a>, <a
href="http://www.irisa.fr/paris/bibadmin/show.php?id=106">link to the
paper</a>). Finally, in the framework of the IRISA-Sun research
agreement, he spends 3 month on optimizing JXTA-C and JuxMem-C
communication layers over grid infrastructures. This work partly uses
<a href="http://runtime.futurs.inria.fr/PadicoTM/">PadicoTM</a>, an
high-performance communication framework for grids. It makes it
possible to transparently by-passing TCP/IP stack on high-performance
network such as <a href="http://www.myri.com/">Myrinet</a>, for
improved performance. Mathieu loves spending time on benchmarking,
understanding and tuning JXTA (especially the C binding).

His published papers on JXTA can be found on the <a
href="http://www.jxta.org/research/">research page</a> of jxta.org,
and his full list of publications <a
href="http://www.irisa.fr/paris/bibadmin/show.php?author=Mathieu_Jan">here</a>. Finally,
he regularly supervises practical works on JXTA for undergraduate
students at INSA Rennes.
