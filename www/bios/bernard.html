        Bernard Traversat is currently the senior engineering manager for the 
        <a href="http://www.jxta.org">JXTA</a> and <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/solutions/rfid/">RFID</a> 
        engineering groups at Sun Microsystems. He is the Sun's representative 
        to <a href="http://www.jxta.org/community/board/boardrules.html">JXTA 
        community board</a>. He is the co-project owner of the <a href="http://platform.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JXTA-J2SE</a>, 
        the <a href="http://jxta-c.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JXTA-C</a>, 
        and <a href="http://jxme.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectHome">JXTA-J2ME</a> 
        project on jxta.org. He is spending most of his time lately on the JXTA-C 
        and JXTA-J2ME implementations. Bernard co-authored the &quot;<a href="http://www.jxta.org/bookshelf.html#Nutshell">JXTA 
        in a Nutshell</a>&quot; book by O'Reilly Press. Previously he led Sun's 
        effort in pervasive computing for small consumer devices, and was lead 
        developer on the SunCluster product. Prior to that, he worked at the NASA 
        Ames Research Center on distributed-memory operating systems for massively 
        parallel supercomputers. He has numerous technical publications in distributed-memory 
        operating systems and resource management systems. He received his Ph.D. 
        degree from the Florida State University.</p>
      <p>The simplicity of an asynchronous and secure decentralized peer-to-peer 
        protocol to reconstruct the Internet is the brilliant idea of a visionary 
        mind: <a href="http://www.jxta.org/bios/BioArchive.html#Joy">Bill Joy</a>. 
        Bernard remembers clearly one afternoon. They were waiting for Bill to 
        join the meeting from his Aspen's office for a video conference. They 
        discussed different ideas for more than three hours. The same night at 
        2:00AM, Bill sent the group an email that defined the overall architecture 
        of <a href="http://www.jxta.org/project/www/JXTAFAQTech.html">JXTA</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>Since then, JXTA has been capturing the mind set of developers. <a href="http://www.jxta.org/bios/BioArchive.html">Developers</a> 
        are using JXTA in many different ways to build applications that overcome 
        today Internet limitations, and bring back the Internet to its origin: 
        a highly-decentralized, scalable, and resilient network. Today government 
        agencies, <a href="http://www.jxta.org/universities/universityarchive.html">universities</a>, 
        research labs, and <a href="http://www.jxta.org/project/www/companies/companyarchive.html">commercial 
        companies</a> are building all kinds of JXTA applications.</p>
      <p>Bernard states &quot;JXTA is also the dedicated work of a few engineers 
        here at Sun and within the JXTA community that never doubted on what we 
        were doing. I have learned to appreciate the values of working for an 
        open-source project, and having people helped us implement the JXTA vision.</p>
      <p>This has been pure joy for me to work on JXTA ;-)&quot;</p>
