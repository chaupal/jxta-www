Warren Strange, AKA wstrange on the JXTA aliases, works for Sun Microsystems in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He is in Sun Professional Services working as an IT Architect. By night, he is a graduate student at Athabasca University. He is married, has two kids, and in his copious spare time (not) loves to golf, ski, and windsurf (windsurfing pretty much relegated to the rare vacation!).
<P> 
He started working on Project JXTA in January 2003 and spends about 15% of his time on JXTA though he wishes it was more. This is his first open source project. He is currently working on a project to integrate Jini and JXTA technologies. 
      <P> <a href="http://user-wstrange.jini.org/jxtajeri/JxtaJeriProgGuide.html">JxtaJeri</a> 
        is a Jini Extended RMI implementation using JXTA Pipes. The first part 
        of this project is an implementation of a Jini ERI (Extensible RMI) transport 
        that uses JXTA pipes. This enables services and clients to use the familiar 
        RMI programming model, but take advantage of the JXTA peer to peer network 
        which enables communication through firewalls and NAT. 
      <P> 
Currently, he has a working Jini ERI Endpoint that uses JXTA. He has tested running the Jini Lookup Service "reggie" running over JXTA. The next step is to experiment with Jini service discovery over the JXTA network - using both unicast and multicast-like discovery.
<P> 
Warren has always found Jini and JXTA to be interesting technologies. This project is a great way for him to learn more about the two technologies by integrating them together. He has always liked the elegance of the Jini model (the focus on interface vs. protocols). His goal is to enable Jini services to be deployed across ad hoc peer to peer networks.
