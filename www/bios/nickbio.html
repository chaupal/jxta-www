<P>Nick Lee is the Chief Software Developer at <a 
href="http://www.mediashell.net">MediaShell</a> and a contributor to the Spec 
Project. He spends approximately
20 hours a week on Project JXTA. He is new to Open Source and has been
active on the discuss@jxta.org mailing list. He's interested in the
overall goals, requirements and direction of Project JXTA. </P>

<P>Nick has made contributions in discovering a number of discrepancies between
the spec and implementation. He has identified the need for
a more complete spec, which is his main motivator in his participation on
the Spec project. He's also getting involved in the community by talling
up the votes on issues that arise on the discuss@jxta.org mailing list.</P>

<P>
Nick thinks that Project JXTA has 2 purposes:
<ol>
<li>Project JXTA provides a conceptual framework for people to think
about P2P systems.  There are many conceptual constructs in the JXTA
technology that are very basic in the P2P world. The JXTA technology
provides a common and flexible architecture, so that programmers don't
have to re-think such issues when they design a P2P system. Even if
Project JXTA doesn't go mainstream, it will provide a valuable model
for people to evaluate and analyze P2P systems.

<li> Project JXTA defines a common semantic on which P2P systems are
built. P2P systems are so diverse and their algorithms so
sophisticated, that the practicality of this goal remains to be seen.
Nevertheless, Project JXTA is an aggressive step towards this
direction.</P>
