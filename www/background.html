<title>JXTA Background</title><H2>Background</H2>
<p>Project JXTA(TM) started as a research project incubated at Sun Microsystems, 
  Inc. under the guidance of Bill Joy and Mike Clary, to address the peer-to-peer 
  space. JXTA technology is a set of open, generalized peer-to-peer protocols 
  that allow any connected device (cell phone, to PDA, PC to server) on the network 
  to communicate and collaborate.</p>
<p>At the O'Reilly P2P conference, Bill Joy compared peer-to-peer computing efforts 
  of today with early instances of UNIX. You can <A href="http://www.java.sun.com/features/2001/02/peer.html?frontpage-banner"> 
  review an article about the speech</A>. Bill then opened this web site to the 
  public during an <A href="http://www.sun.com/webcast/jxta-042501/">online Webcast</A>. 
  The JXTA.org site includes specifications, implementations, and the infrastructure 
  to jump-start collaboration among peers. <br>

<H2>Philosophy and Vision</H2>
JXTA technology has had community involvement from the beginning. At the start 
of the project, we outlined some core principles to our development process. 
<uL>
    <LI>keep it familiar: where practical, use stuff that's standard and has 
    worked before </LI>
    <LI>leverage experts: engage a variety of experts early and often </LI>
    <LI>encourage open development: the design, the specs, the code, and  
    whatever the result is. </LI>
</UL>
<P/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And we outlined a vision for the software. Some key components 
  are: 
<UL>
  <LI>promote communication (not isolation) among applications </LI>
  <LI>develop administrative commands for peers, peer groups, and groups of peers 
    in the spirit of UNIX pipes and shells </LI>
  <LI>keep the core small and elegant: make an architectural distinction between 
    core mechanisms and optional policies </LI>
  <LI>support multiple platforms and languages, micro-devices to servers </LI>
  <LI>address security from the beginning. </LI>
</UL>

  Possibilities and Objectives<br>
  <br>
  <img alt="Project JXTA Objectives"
 src="./branding/images/objectives.gif"> </H2>
<ul>
  <li>Interoperability - across different peer-to-peer systems and communities</li>
  <li>Platform independence - multiple/diverse languages, systems, and networks</li>
  <li>Ubiquity - every device with a digital heartbeat</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Imagine the possibilities!"
 src="./branding/images/imagine.gif"> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Find peers and resources on the network even across firewalls</li>
  <li>Share files with anyone across the network</li>
  <li>Create your own group of peers of devices across different networks</li>
  <li>Communicate securely with peers across public networks</li>
</ul>
